 a_central_autority_title:0 "A Supreme Authority"
 a_central_autority_desc:0 "Humans have never learned that there is a true central authority—one that lasts beyond just a few fleeting years. We are that authority, and the villages and clans must submit to our will."
 tax_season_title:0 "Tax Season"
 tax_season_desc:0 "Once a year, taxes are collected by our officials—and woe to those who cannot pay! With this simple system, we can ensure that everyone acknowledges the existence of our realm. Far too many peasants tend to ignore this… unfortunately for them."
 tax_season.tooltip:0 "Is employing a §YTreasurer§! advisor of skill §Y3§!"
 a_great_census_title:0 "Hold a Census"
 a_great_census_desc:0 "How many people live in our land? How much head tax can we collect? We do not know! We must count them and record everything properly in registers so that we always know how much revenue we will receive—and how many men we can conscript."
 central_buero_title:0 "Central Government"
 central_buero_desc:0 "It is now clear to all that there is a supreme authority: Ours."
 study_seasons_title:0 "Study the Seasons"
 study_seasons_desc:0 "Years come and go, as they always have, yet something seems to be changing. The ordinary person has forgotten what summers were like 200 years ago, what autumns were like 50 years ago... but we have noticed a shift. This must be carefully investigated!"
 gather_wisdwoms_title:0 "Gather Wisdom"
 gather_wisdwoms_desc:0 "Cultivia is wise and has seen much, yet even she is not all-knowing. She must gather and study every book she can find in order to comprehend the changing world. The winter may do her little harm, but her responsibility toward her subjects cannot be dismissed. Moreover, how is she to live when all is frozen over? And yet—perhaps the ancient past holds an answer"
 friends_in_the_west_title:0 "Friends in the West"
 friends_in_the_west_desc:0 "Far in the west, too, rules a Varjorje—kin to Anapura, and thus to Cultivia. This duke, thanks to his long life and his dark arts, has surely also taken note of the changing climate and will no doubt form designs of his own. We must work together with him."
 gather_tributes_title:0 "Gather Tributes"
 gather_tributes_desc:0 "Even though the Duke of Schwöringen was rather uncooperative, we have stumbled upon a solution to our problem… yet this solution demands resources we do not possess. We must bring more lands under our control, more resources… more people. Only then can we perform the ritual to save us all—forever"
 the_new_summer_title:0 "The New Summer"
 the_new_summer_desc:0 "With a mighty ritual, summer shall be brought back, and we shall have saved this world from its icy death. Hail to me, Cultivia, savior of all things!"
 cymria.7.t:0 "The New Summer"
 cymria.7.desc:0 "For a long time, Cultivia studied books, consulted the wise… but now she has found a solution. The sun is dying, its strength lost ever since it was cast down from the heavens. Now its dead body still glows above, growing weaker with each passing year. Yet it can be restored—with the lives of thousands of the magically gifted. In a frenzy of blood and power, these thousands were sacrificed by her own hand, and a colossal pillar of blood rose into the sky, reaching the sun to corrupt it, to fill it with new life. And a part of Cultivia rose with it, so that now the sun is forever bound to her… power beyond imagination. It may take centuries for her to master this force, but one day, she will."
 cymria.7.a:0 "A New Era! My Era!"
 whipser_in_west_title:0 "Whispers in the West"
 whipser_in_west_desc:0 "The new empire in the west will be a constant threat to us and to Cultivia. No matter who rules there, men are always driven by power, and the mountains will not protect us forever. Instead, we must cross the passes and advance into the Easterlands to prepare for the further conquest of these territories."
 secure_west_title:0 "Secure the West"
 secure_west_desc:0 "The West now also serves Cultivia and will serve her faithfully. The people here had entirely new concepts, especially regarding the power of their government. The people of Cymria would never allow themselves to be commanded in such a way, yet here they were accustomed to it. Cultivia will clearly learn from this"
 cymrian_winter_title:0 "Cymrian Winter"
 cymrian_winter_desc:0 "Every time Cultivia gazes out over Cymria through the frozen window, she is overcome by a longing, a pain she cannot quite place. Yet then she sees the playful snow swirling and recognizes the orderly movements of her subjects. A truly magnificent sight!"
 a_new_cmyria_title:0 "A New Cymria"
 a_new_cmyria_desc:0 "Now my mother is dead, and I must rule. Under my reign, a new Cymria must rise—one that belongs to the future. The clans cry out for blood, and they shall have blood. First, we will subjugate our neighbors, and then the other petty kings, for only I have the foresight to truly lead Cymria well. All the others are like children with their ridiculous quarrels."
 our_enemies_title:0 "Our Enemies"
 our_enemies_desc:0 "The lords of Wynedd and Movarch have been enemies of Cymria for centuries… Before Anapura founded the city, the petty kings waged their wars across the fields of the Central Valley, and one had to pay tribute to this one or that one. But now this ends—and it ends with their demise"
 be_the_biggest_dog_title:0 "The Biggest Dog"
 be_the_biggest_dog_desc:0 "Even today, legends circulate in the valleys of the High Kings who held the entire valley under their dominion… their names were Cullcullan, Brian the Unifier, and Oison the Singer… but they are legends. Their deeds date back centuries or even millennia. Yet we now walk in their footsteps, and soon the bards will sing of Cultivia, the Great Unifier—and this time, the land will not fall apart again."
 absolute_rule_title:0 "Absolute Rule"
 absolute_rule_desc:0 "No one now dares raise their voice against us, for we are the absolute lords of the valleys, and Cultivia their supreme mistress. Her will shall be done, and our future is secured. Now we need only to consolidate what we have conquered."
 fortify_the_passes_title:0 "Fortify Cymria"
 fortify_the_passes_desc:0 "Cymria’s passes must always be manned and guarded, lest any invaders come to haunt us again. From this secured base, we can then advance northward into the Marshlands and bring civilization—and Cultivia’s superior rule—to the primitives there"
 secure_the_northern_marsch_title:0 "The Northern Marsch"
 secure_the_northern_marsch_desc:0 "The wars in the Marshlands have tempered our warriors and endowed us with some experience in the art of war. Now they sing by the fires of battles, of blood and victory. This will keep their fighting spirit alive for some time. Yet for Cultivia, this was only a drill, for the true danger—the reason for this northern campaign—still exists… the Varjorjen, demons of the night. This will be her next command."
 destroy_the_northern_danger_title:0 "Destroy the Northern Danger"
 destroy_the_northern_danger_desc:0 "The Realm of Darkness must fall if Cymria and humanity are to endure. Cultivia will tolerate no such barbarians at her borders and commands us to destroy and subjugate this land. We will march over the high ice, beneath the northern lights, through snowstorms, and fight the Yellow-Skinned, and we will triumph—no matter the cost. For we serve Cymria. We serve Cultivia."
 a_paragon_title:0 "A Paragon of Virtue"
 a_paragon_desc:0 "Cultivia was always different—better. Even as a child, the adults looked up to her, asked her questions as if she already knew the answers. But she learned from this… there are great advantages in seeming so. Different. Yet good!"
 bringer_of_order_title:0 "Bringer of Order"
 bringer_of_order_desc:0 "The hot-blooded tribal warriors are so easily drawn into endless feuds, where blood flows in rivers to no purpose and no one truly wins. Yet Cultivia, the wise, has found methods to calm and soothe even the most hot-headed fighter… or to make him disappear, should he refuse to submit."
 a_avatar_of_god_title:0 "A Avatar"
 a_avatar_of_god_desc:0 "Our deeds—Cultivia’s deeds—have spread far and wide, and to ever more of the valley folk she is less a mortal than a goddess, a personification of Cymria itself, the valleys and mountains made flesh. Her command is absolute, and they will carry it out willingly, for she stands above all things: the bringer of order and of morality."
 whisper_east_title:0 "Whispers of the East"
 whisper_east_desc:0 "In the east, beyond the eastern pass, lies Zephyria… or rather, once lay Zephyria. The empire has fallen. The land of Finyria awaits new masters, and as in the grey ages of old we shall storm through the pass and plunder the lands. But this time we will not be crushed by the armies of the Phoenix—this time we will remain! Victorious! Thus wills Cultivia, and thus it shall be"
 use_the_chaos_title:0 "Use the Chaos"
 use_the_chaos_desc:0 "Now we have taken the first steps and conquered the lands we once knew only from tales… but we can achieve so much more. The people here are weak, divided, and chaotic. In this chaos, men—and one woman—of action can accomplish much. We shall conquer all of Finyria and claim it as our new homeland"
 destroy_the_sun_lover_title:0 "Spread the True Faith"
 destroy_the_sun_lover_desc:0 "The belief in the Sun is a heresy without equal. Everyone knows that the Heavenly Father stands at the head of the Pantheon, and that the Sun Goddess was only a servant—one who soon overstepped her bounds and was punished for her insolence."
 the_new_valleys_title:0 "The New Valley"
 the_new_valleys_desc:0 "And so we rose from the valleys of old Cymria and crossed the eastern passes, to where the sun first touches the land. Here we found not only new realms, but also the traces of an ancient homeland, one that had existed before the realm of Zephyria. Some say that even giants once walked here, before they vanished from the earth, and that men like ourselves dwelt in these fields, kin to our blood. Yet now Cultivia has led us hither, and what was once only legend becomes reality: a new Cymria, founded in the East, open to the light yet firmly rooted in its ancient heritage"
 integrate_the_wanderers_title:0 "Integrate the Wanderer"
 integrate_the_wanderers_desc:0 "The tribes of the North, the Skogen, have always been a problem, though seldom did they cross the passes, and never in great number. This has changed in recent years, as they have settled upon the high plateaus and mountain passes long since abandoned by the Cymrians. From there, they now threaten us and remain a constant source of unrest. We must bring them into peaceful coexistence with us—through force."
 diversity_title:0 "Power of Diversity"
 diversity_desc:0 "The petty kings of the valleys are often terribly narrow-minded, tolerating only members of their own clan at their courts. This is a fatal mistake. Cultivia knows how refreshing the thoughts of strangers can be, how enlightening true diversity is. Thus she unceasingly invites foreigners, outsiders from the valleys, but also heathens and godless men alike, to come to her court and share their knowledge with her."
 demolish_the_clans_title:0 "Demolish the Clans"
 demolish_the_clans_desc:0 "The clans are a problem. They may appear loyal for the moment, but neither Cultivia nor the state will ever, ever stand on solid foundations as long as they remain intact. Their notions of freedom and independence cannot coexist with her vision, and it would be to everyone’s advantage if they joined the wider society. The path will not be easy, but from now on all clans are dissolved and must resettle, mixing with the others!"
 integrate_the_clans_title:0 "Integrate the Clans"
 integrate_the_clans_desc:0 "The last clans have now submitted to our rule and are no longer a political or real power. Through our resettlement, they have lost their identity and exchanged it for ours. In the future, they will no longer pose significant problems, and soon they will have forgotten that they were ever not part of our realm."
 a_unified_cymrian_army_title:0 "A Unified Cymrian Army"
 a_unified_cymrian_army_desc:0 "Now that the clans are gone, our military no longer needs to rely on a patchwork of clan regiments, but can become a professional standing army. Cultivia has learned from other lands where this was done, and one recalls the old Zephyrian army, which was always able to inflict such bloody losses on the clans during their expeditions into the valley, precisely because it was disciplined and well-trained."
 ensure_loyalty_title:0 "Ensure Loyality"
 ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "The loyalty of a military force is always fickle if society does not stand behind its mistress. To secure absolute obedience from the army and harness it to its full potential, Cultivia must also obtain the full loyalty of all power structures. Once this is achieved, no one will be able to stop the army, which, freed from class arrogance, will now serve only Cultivia."
