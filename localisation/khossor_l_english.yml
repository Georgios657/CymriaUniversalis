 khossor.16.t:0 "Navigators Grave"
 khossor.16.desc:0 "At the western cape, there has been a burial mound since time immemorial, revered as sacred by the locals. One of our students took a closer look, and when she ordered the tomb to be opened and questioned the bones, it turned out that no chieftain lay there but a captain from a distant land in the west!

Now, we have reached the oldest layer of graves and encountered a very active spirit. She calls herself Arna and seems to be the oldest witch buried here, readily offering information. After long recounting, she explained to us that she was once the one who founded the witches of Khossor. This reminds us of the stories where the first witch invites the local chieftains and their families to her, kills the men, cooks the children, and drinks their mothers' blood. A truly diabolical role model!"

With a voice of death, she spoke to us, demanding the results of our research and her rightful throne. For she founded the witches! She has earned the immortality that her father once denied her. But at the time of her death, she was not yet ready, and she bound her soul to the buried body, waiting until another would discover the power. Only in this way can she restore her body and no longer be forced to exist as a nearly motionless... abomination."
