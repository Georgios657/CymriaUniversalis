 riefen.2.t:0 "The Destiny of Riefen"
 riefen.2.desc:0 "We have taken Ziphyria — the great capital of the old empire that once humbled us time and again. And now we stand at the crossroads of destiny. Shall we take vengeance for the blood they spilled, or shall we see this victory as the spark of a new dawn? Are we merely the stewards of a new age, or are we the true heirs of the Phoenix — those who rise from ash to forge a brighter flame? The city lies silent before us, its towers cracked, its banners fallen, its echoes filled with ghosts of pride and ruin. What we do next will define not only who we are, but what the world will become after us. If we choose vengeance, the cycle of fire continues — old hatreds reborn in new faces. If we choose renewal, the ashes of Ziphyria may yet give rise to something greater than empire or conquest. The choice, Riefinians, is ours: will we be the keepers of wrath, or the builders of a reborn world?"

 riefen.1.t:0 "The Great Escape"
 riefen.1.desc:0 "We fled from our homeland before the curse of the Ghost-Grass, northward across the breadth of our lands. The journey was long and filled with sorrow. Many of our kin were captured, enslaved, or lost to the darkness that followed in our wake. But those who remain—the strong, the steadfast, the unbroken—have now reached the safety of the northern lands. Though our hearts are heavy with loss, our spirits endure. Here, in the cold and the quiet, we shall rebuild. From the ashes of what was, we will forge what must be. The Riefinians still stand—and as long as we draw breath, our story is not over."

 dig_for_more_gold_title:0 "Riefinian Gold"
 dig_for_more_gold_desc:0 "We have our faults, without doubt—chief among them, our love of gold.

Even the Zephyrian Empire once drew it from our soil, and with it gilded the third great gate of Zephyria."
 riefen_gold_art_title:0 "Riefinian Jewelry"
 riefen_gold_art_desc:0 "Our gold is far too precious to be sold away. From the earliest days, our smiths and metalworkers discovered how to shape it into the most wondrous ornaments.

 riefen_brooches_title:0 "Brooches"
 riefen_brooches_desc:0 "The pride of a Riefinian is his brooch, which proclaims his family, his clan, his tribe, and his rank. The highest are wrought from gold, followed by copper, and lastly iron. The patterns in which they are forged speak of the tribe, the stones of the clan, and finally the engraving of his family."
 riefian_armor_title:0 "Golden Armor"
 riefian_armor_desc:0 "Our armors are both feared and respected, their golden gleam—whether true gold or polished copper—proclaiming our might. They are crafted with skill and balance, highly flexible, neither too heavy nor too light. Perfectly fashioned for a life in the saddle."
 riefnian_host_title:0 "The Riefinian Host"
 riefnian_host_desc:0 "Our armies and our people are exhausted and depleted. Fleeing the Atagordians, the weather, and the mysterious plague has taken a heavy toll and claimed many lives.

 iron_of_talio_desc:0 "Iron is strength, iron is power, and only the iron fist is respected. We must reforge our weapons and armor and re-equip our armies if we are to endure.

 cloth_of_leferen_title:0 "Clothes of Leferen"
 cloth_of_leferen_desc:0 "The city of Leferen, the last of our people, still prides itself in the old Riefinian tradition of spinning and weaving. These fabrics are the true legacy of our people: we wrap our dead in them and lay weapons in their graves. Yet garments endure, for the iron is stolen. The linen and the wool from which they are made we grow and shear from our flocks ourselves, and we sell the cloth to our neighbors."
 golden_cloths_title:0 "Cloths of Gold"
 golden_cloths_desc:0 "With delicate threads of gold, the weavers craft the garments of the rich and kings, in the ancient manner. Numerous blessings and protective rites are woven into the fabric, so that the clothing shields against all manner of misfortune, and at the end is consecrated by a priest of Tengri.

 champions_of_people_title:0 "New Leaders"
 champions_of_people_desc:0 "Our new people and our new army also need men to lead them to victory.

We must hold fast to defense, that we may remain here, and never again be cast out."
 raid_the_border_title:0 "Raid the Border"

 the_zephyrian_border_title:0 "Border of Zephyria"
 the_zephyrian_border_desc:0 "The old realm of Zephyria has long accompanied us and has defeated us often enough. But now it is gone and we remain—what does that tell us about who is mightier? The borderlands are weak and unprotected, and we will conquer them for the glory of Tengri!"

 siege_the_city_of_sun_title:0 "Siege the City of Sun"
 siege_the_city_of_sun_desc:0 "Ziphyria… the City of the Sun… we have heard much of that city, and some of our countrymen were even killed there in the arena after being paraded in Zephyrian triumphs as prisoners of war. Now the times have changed and we stand in that city… but do we come as destroyers or as the new heirs of the Sun? Will we take revenge and sack the city, steal its treasures, destroy, rape and murder, or will we set our names upon its reliefs and establish ourselves there as the heirs of the Phoenixes?"
 the_grand_horde_title:0 "The Grand Horde"
 the_grand_horde_desc:0 "The Riefian Realm now stretches from the north of Zephyria to the south of Qualia, from the Qareli to the Altiden in the west.

 modernize_the_army_title:0 "Modernize the Army"
 modernize_the_army_desc:0 "For a long time it was enough to shower the enemy with arrows and then finish them with sword and spear in a storming assault, but we must adapt to the new world… to new weapons and tactics. Firearms are now the great new thing, and they demand new tactics, new customs…"
 grass_armour_title:0 "Armour of Grass"
 grass_armour_desc:0 "The ghost-grass is, besides its poison, almost indestructible. Skilled weavers have managed to weave it into armor that can protect its wearer from nearly all stabbing wounds. Combined with leather and iron or copper, these are armors that are both light and highly secure. Our bravest warriors wear them, unafraid of the poison, and gain glory in battle for it."
 the_brave_grass_title:0 "Brave Grass Riders"
 the_brave_grass_desc:0 "All who wear the ghost-grass armor for too long are doomed to die a slow and agonizing death. Yet for the greatest of warriors — the sworn bodyguards of our princes — this is but another mark of their unshakable loyalty. We shall forever honor these doomed souls, for they are the true heroes of our people."
 the_western_steppe_title:0 "The Western Steppe"
 the_western_steppe_desc:0 "The western steppes are not inhabited by the Atagordians, but by foreign peoples who are more settled. They are weak and deserve us as their new overlords. At the end of the western steppe lies a vast canyon carved by a river, impassable for us. Yet beyond it stretch further lands! Once we find a way to cross, we shall continue our hunt for the horizon."
 the_bridge_title:0 "The Grand Bridge"
 the_bridge_desc:0 "The great bridge that stretches across the Cymria, forged by the hands of our forebear Ponti, is not merely stone and timber—it is a testament to our strength, our ingenuity, and our unyielding spirit. It has withstood storms, time, and the trials of men, and now it calls to us once more. We must repair it, mend its cracks, and fortify its pillars, so that the Horde may ride westward without fear, carrying our honor, our banners, and the fire of our ancestors into new lands. Let no obstacle stop us, for this bridge is the path of destiny, and destiny favors the bold!"
 the_dead_land_title:0 "The Far-Western Steppe"
 the_dead_land_desc:0 "The steppe to the west, stretching all the way to the distant high mountains, is a cursed land, haunted by restless spirits and littered with ancient ruins, with only sparse, stubborn grass to mark the ground. Yet we shall not be deterred! We are Riefinian—we fear nothing! The whispers of the dead and the shadows of the past mean nothing to those who carry the fire of our people in their hearts. Forward, my warriors! Let the winds of the steppe carry our banners, let the ground quake beneath our march, for no curse, no ghost, no ruin can stand against the courage of the Riefinian Horde!"
 the_plague_of_grass_title:0 "Plague of Ghost-Grass"
 the_plague_of_grass_desc:0 "The ghost-grass is spreading ever further into the steppe and we fled from its poison and its near-indestructibility. It grows taller than ordinary grass—up to several metres high—and it glows a pale green at night, so that over the steppe it covers there is always a dangerous shimmer. We must take measures to fight it or we will all die."
 search_for_the_start_title:0 "Search for the Origin"
 search_for_the_start_desc:0 "The curse of the Ghost-Grass is no random blight — it has a root, a beginning hidden somewhere in those ruined places. We will seek that root with every eye, every hand, every blade among us. We will uncover what birthed this shadow, rip it out, and bury it so deep that not even whispering winds can call it back. Fail we will not — for if we do, all of us will perish. Stand with me, Riefinians! Light your torches, mount your steeds, steel your hearts: tonight we hunt the source, and tomorrow the steppe will know that the Riefinian name means neither fear nor surrender!"
 ask_the_ghosts_title:0 "Ask the Ghosts"
 ask_the_ghosts_desc:0 "The spirits of the past—our forebears—hold knowledge beyond our reach. They walked these lands when the world was young; their memories cling to the earth like smoke. We must seek out the proper bones, the resting places of those who remembered, and put our questions to them. Not with idle words, but with rites, with respect, and with steel ready at our sides. Let the seers tend the embers and call the names; let our historians bring tokens, and let the brave unearth what must be unearthed. Only by listening to our ancestors — by learning what they saw, what they buried, and what they tried to hide — will we discover the root of this curse. Gather, Riefinians! Prepare the torches, sharpen the minds and the blades: we will find the right bones, we will ask the right questions, and we will end this darkness for good."
 secure_the_poleia_title:0 "Secure the Poleia"
 secure_the_poleia_desc:0 "Poleia Attika is the source of the Plague. Here, great evil was wrought, and only a magical ritual can lift the curse… or transform it into something else, if that is our will. The land itself remembers the darkness that was unleashed, and the spirits cry out for reckoning. We stand at the edge of destiny, Riefinians, with fire in our hearts and steel in our hands. The choice is ours: to end the curse forever, or to bend it to our purpose. Let no hesitation hold us back, for only boldness can claim victory over ancient malice. Gather your courage, sharpen your senses, and prepare: the hour of reckoning is upon us!"
 end_curse_title:0 "End the Curse"
 end_curse_desc:0 "Now that the curse has been broken, we must see what the future holds for us. Yet we must not be blind to what has passed—precautions must be taken so that such darkness can never rise again. We are Riefinians! Our eyes must be sharp, our hands ready, and our spirits unyielding. Let the lessons of this ordeal guide our steps, let our watch be constant, and let no shadow ever catch us unprepared. The future is ours to shape, but only if we remain vigilant and steadfast!"
 ask_forgiveness_title:0 "Ask for forgiveness"
 ask_forgiveness_desc:0 "We have clearly committed a wrong. The curse-weaver was an honorable foe and deserved an honorable end. We must seek her spirit and ask for forgiveness. Let our hearts show humility, let our voices carry respect, and let our actions honor what she truly was. For only by acknowledging our mistakes and making amends can we restore balance and ensure that the shadows of vengeance do not linger among us. Gather, Riefinians, and let our plea rise to the spirits—may it bring peace to her soul and guidance to ours."
