From this seat of power, the western seas are governed, and the king’s edicts flow across the waters with the authority of both tradition and magic."

 demon_invasion.1.t:0 "The Demon Invasion Begins"
 demon_invasion.1.d:0 "The demons are storming our land, and we must stop them. They pour through shattered gates and corrupted ground, leaving ruin in their wake. Villages burn, roads fall silent, and fear spreads faster than any army. If we do not stand together now, there will be nothing left to defend. This is the hour of resolve. Every delay strengthens the enemy, every doubt feeds the darkness. We must rally our forces, seal the gates, and drive the invaders back into the abyss from which they came—before our world is lost to chaos and night."
 demon_invasion.1.a:0 "Fight them!"

 demon_invasion.2.t:0 "The Demon Gate Closes"
 demon_invasion.2.d:0 "One way or another, the Demon Gate has closed, and the invasion is over. For now, we may return to our lives in peace, tending to what was broken and mourning what was lost. Yet this calm is only temporary. We must remain vigilant and prepare ourselves for their return, for the darkness beyond the gate has not been destroyed—only delayed. Peace has been restored, but it is a watchful peace, forged in the knowledge that the demons may one day come again."
 demon_invasion.2.a:0 "We are saved!"
 
 demon_invasion.3.t:0 "Another Demon Horde!"
 demon_invasion.3.d:0 "A new demon horde has emerged. From the scorched lands and shattered ruins they rise, driven by the same dark will that once threatened to consume our world. Their numbers grow by the day, and the signs are unmistakable: corrupted soil, twisted creatures, and whispers of dread carried on the wind. This is no isolated incident, but the echo of a greater evil stirring once more. If we do not act swiftly and decisively, this new horde may become the harbinger of a far deadlier invasion yet to come."
 demon_invasion.3.a:0 "Stand together!"
 
 demon_invasion.4.t:0 "People are losing our trust"
 demon_invasion.4.d:0 "The people are losing faith in our government and now seek salvation in their own small states. Separatists have risen. Across the land, banners of unity are being torn down and replaced by local symbols and private oaths. Communities fortify their borders, leaders declare independence, and old loyalties crumble under fear and uncertainty. What once was a single realm now threatens to fracture into countless competing factions. These separatist movements feed on doubt and chaos, weakening our ability to respond to the growing dangers around us. If this division continues, the realm may fall not to demons or invaders—but to its own loss of trust and shared purpose."
 demon_invasion.4.a:0 "Splitters!"
 
 demon_invasion.5.t:0 "Our rule is to weak!"
 demon_invasion.5.d:0 "Claimants have risen in our capital, seeking to seize the throne for themselves. They declare that they alone are capable of mastering the crisis, accusing the current rule of weakness and failure. Within the city, rival factions gather supporters, spread proclamations, and undermine what remains of public order. Ambition now rivals fear, and power is contested not only on the battlefield, but in council halls, marketplaces, and shadowed streets. If these pretenders are not confronted, the struggle for the throne may plunge the capital—and the realm—into open civil war."
 demon_invasion.5.a:0 "Kill them!"
 
 demon_invasion.6.t:0 "A Demons Offer"
 demon_invasion.6.d:0 "A demon has appeared before us, offering power beyond measure—if only we would swear ourselves to the cause of the Demon King. He promises dominion, strength, and survival, naming us his highest lieutenants, rulers in a world remade by fire and shadow. His words are honeyed and his bargains precise. He speaks of order born from chaos, of an end to fear through absolute power. Yet behind the promise lies a chain, forged in obedience and sealed with damnation. To accept would be to trade our freedom for might, our future for a throne of ash. Now the choice stands before us, stark and unforgiving: resist and endure the storm on our own terms—or kneel and become instruments of a darkness that will never be satisfied. The fate of the realm may hinge on which path we choose."
 demon_invasion.6.a:0 "Yess..."
 demon_invasion.6.b:0 "Betray my humanity?!"

 demon_invasion.7.t:0 "The Faithful"
 demon_invasion.7.d:0 "Our struggle is a just one, and others have recognized this truth. Volunteers have taken up arms, answering the call not out of duty, but out of conviction. From towns, villages, and distant regions they come, ready to stand against chaos and division. Their resolve strengthens our cause, reminding all that despite fear and unrest, the spirit of unity and resistance has not yet been broken."
 demon_invasion.7.a:0 "Together we will win!"

Fanatics of unknown allegiance have erected a Demon Gate, and now the servants of darkness are pouring forth, rampaging across the countryside and spreading fear wherever they go. Throughout our land, whispers fill the dark alleys—talk of the coming King of Demons, spoken in hushed voices and fearful tones. Panic grows with every passing night, and never before has trust in our government been so fragile. The shadows lengthen, order falters, and many fear that this calamity is only the beginning of a far greater descent into chaos."

She embodies transition and transformation, presiding over every passage—from life to death, from calm seas to raging storms. As the Lady of Tempests, she both grants land and claims it again, reshaping coasts and fates with equal indifference. Unpredictable and absolute, she is the true Mistress of the Sea, the one who sends the winds and commands the tides. To love her is to fear her, for her blessings and her wrath are one and the same, carried upon the ever-changing waters."

 the_lord_of_demons_religion_desc:0 "The Lord of Demons is chaos incarnate, a power born of another world where demons, malevolent spirits, and savage, brawling creatures dwell. From this realm beyond reality, his influence seeps into existence, warping land and fate alike. Through vast gates raised by his devoted followers, his legions will one day pour forth—an unending tide of ruin and madness—bringing calamity upon the world. Wherever these portals open, order collapses and terror reigns. The Dokkaebi are his servants, cunning and cruel spirits who thrive in places where the veil between worlds has worn thin. They gather upon distant islands and liminal shores, where only a fragile curtain separates the mortal realm from the Demon World. There they wait, whispering promises of power and sowing chaos, ever ready for the moment when the gates are fully opened and their master’s dominion begins."

 estate_church_merman_pacifism_desc:0 "For a long time, the merfolk have lived as pacifists, rejecting most forms of violence. At peace with themselves and their surroundings, they place their trust in the protective embrace of the mist. The fog is both shield and sanctuary, concealing their settlements and softening the world beyond. Rather than meeting force with force, the merfolk rely on harmony, patience, and the quiet guardianship of nature itself, believing that true safety lies not in weapons, but in balance."

 estate_nobles_pacifist_nobility_desc:0 "The nobles of the merfolk are rarely found on the battlefield, choosing instead to devote their attention to their ships and fleets. Masters of navigation and seamanship, they see the sea as their true domain rather than the chaos of open combat. True to their traditions, they reject conflict whenever possible, preferring diplomacy, trade, and careful stewardship of their vessels over the shedding of blood. To them, war is a failure of harmony, and the preservation of balance upon the seas is a far greater duty."

Commerce is the foundation of their society, and the free flow of goods across sea and shore is seen as essential to prosperity and stability. When trade routes are threatened or markets disrupted, tensions rise swiftly, and what is usually a calm and orderly people can be driven to loud protest and upheaval."

 mer_soldier:0 "Mer-Soldier"
 mer_soldierDESCR:0 "The soldiers of the mermen are traditionally only lightly armored, favoring mobility over heavy protection. They wield massive tridents, weapons as deadly as they are symbolic, and are trained to fight both on land and in the water. In the sea, their strength and reach make them fearsome opponents, while on land their discipline and adaptability allow them to hold their own against heavily armored foes. This balance of speed, power, and versatility defines merman warfare and reflects their dual nature as warriors of both shore and deep."
 mer_meridon:0 "Meridom"
 mer_meridonDESCR:0 "The Meridoms represent the pinnacle of the mermen’s champions. Clad in bronze armor and wielding heavy tridents, there are few foes capable of withstanding their onslaught. On land or beneath the waves, their presence turns the tide of battle. Each Meridom is a living weapon, trained from youth to embody strength, discipline, and the wrath of the sea. When they advance, resistance breaks like stone beneath the surf."
 mer_infantry:0 "Mer-Infantry"
 mer_infantryDESCR:0 "Equipped with the first firearms, these mermen remain highly skilled in close combat, yet they now possess the ability to thin enemy ranks through disciplined, well-aimed volleys before battle is joined. This combination of traditional martial prowess and emerging gunpowder weapons makes them especially dangerous. Whether advancing from the surf or holding a shoreline, they weaken their foes at range and then strike decisively, blending old ways of war with the new art of fire and smoke."
 mer_drill_infantry:0 "Mer-Drill Infantry"
 mer_drill_infantryDESCR:0 "The mermen have rarely fought in tight formations, as their heavy tridents made such discipline difficult to maintain. With the introduction of firearms, however, fighting in formation has become increasingly important. This new troop type is drilled relentlessly to master coordinated movement and synchronized volleys. As a result, their efficiency on the battlefield has greatly increased, allowing them to combine the power of gunfire with the brutal effectiveness of their traditional weapons."
 mer_navy_seals:0 "Mer-Navy Seals"
 mer_navy_sealsDESCR:0 "The Navy Seals of the mermen represent the last generation of warriors trained to fight with equal mastery on land, aboard ships, and beneath the waves. Their light equipment—deliberately chosen as a rejection of ever-heavier armor and weapons—allows them to respond to the shifting tides of battle with speed and precision. Whether unleashing rapid, disciplined volleys or engaging in daring close-quarters combat, they are at home in every environment. Adaptable, relentless, and highly trained, these elite soldiers embody the future of merman warfare: mobility over mass, skill over brute force, and mastery of every battlefield they enter."
 kelpie_knight:0 "Kelpie Knight"
 kelpie_knightDESCR:0 "Kelpies are underwater horses, creatures of the deep that, like the mermen, can venture onto land. Through the magic that dwells within them, their bodies transform—fins harden and reshape into powerful hooves, allowing them to gallop across shore and battlefield alike. The mermen ride these fearsome beasts as armored knights, clad in heavy mail and bronze, spreading terror both beneath the waves and upon dry land. Whether charging through the surf or thundering across coastal plains, kelpie-mounted warriors are a sight of awe and dread, uniting the power of sea and land in a single, unstoppable force."
 kelpie_riders:0 "Kelpie Riders"
 kelpie_ridersDESCR:0 "With ever-improving armor and weapons, the new generation of kelpie riders are no longer the shining knights of earlier ages. Instead, they represent a new type of warrior—more pragmatic, more lethal, and superior to the old traditions. Stripped of ceremony and excess, these riders are forged for efficiency and dominance. Their mastery of both sea and land warfare surpasses that of their predecessors, making them the apex of modern merman cavalry: faster, deadlier, and perfectly adapted to the brutal realities of the new age of war."
 kelpie_hussar:0 "Kelpie Hussar"
 kelpie_hussarDESCR:0 "The Kelpie Hussars are faster and far more mobile than their predecessors. In an age of gunpowder, speed is their greatest protection—only swiftness can guard against bullets. When they encounter enemy formations that are too dense to be charged safely, the hussars do not commit blindly. Instead, they use their firearms to harass and break up the formation before striking, turning mobility and firepower into a deadly combination. Agile, adaptive, and relentless, the Kelpie Hussars embody the evolution of mounted warfare in a world of steel, shot, and sea."
 helpie_bronce_curssaier:0 "Kelpie Bronce Curassier"
 helpie_bronce_curssaierDESCR:0 "Innovative advances in metallurgy have restored armor to battlefield relevance. The heavy bronze cuirasses of the cuirassiers allow for devastating frontal assaults against nearly any formation. Mounted on Kelpies—creatures far stronger than horses—these warriors can bear even the heaviest armor without losing momentum. When they charge, it is not merely an attack but an overwhelming force, bronze and muscle driving straight through enemy lines with crushing power."
