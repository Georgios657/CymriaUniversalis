 giant_prov.4.desc:0 "For ages, the Giants of Muspelheim made use of the magical treasures brought forth by the steaming hot springs, gifts lifted from the depths of the earth itself. But now the richest of those springs have fallen silent, their power spent. In response, the more industrious among the giants swiftly claimed the land rights surrounding them, turning their efforts toward cultivating grain upon the frost-resistant soil. Thus, Muspelheim enters a new era—one shaped not by the bounty of fire, but by the harvest of the earth"

 kill_trollsnobles_desc:0 "The trolls need no leaders, no nobility—for that is the role we, the giants, shall fulfill. And while we are at it, they require no priests either.

Only by reshaping their structure can lasting stability be secured."
 no_culture_for_trolls_title:0 "There is no troll culture"
 no_culture_for_trolls_desc:0 "We scoff at the notion of a true troll culture, believing that only the Jötnar can create great works of art and craftsmanship. We intend to impress our own traditions upon the trolls, expecting them to adopt the refinement and mastery of the giant realms."

 giant_gloom_title:0 "The Last War"
 giant_gloom_desc:0 "The great forests of the Gloomwood fill our hearts with a deep and ancient joy, for within them lies a fragment of the old world. We still remember the age when these woods stretched all the way to the sea, and when the Rhen dwelled beneath their boughs—a people not unlike humans, yet more gifted in magic and fairer in form. But even they eventually fell to the wrath of the gods. We fought many wars against them in ages past, and now we shall bring the remaining Rhen under our dominion at last"
 the_old_gods_grave_title:0 "Secure the Grave"
 the_old_gods_grave_desc:0 "In the desert lies the Forbidden Tomb, where the souls of the fallen gods are imprisoned. Our gods. Yet they are no longer what they once were, and even in ages past they lacked the strength to endure. We survived—they did not. It falls to us to ensure they remain sealed for all eternity. And should the wards fail, then we must gather every last fragment of their lingering remains before their power can stir again"
 bunderblusses_title:0 "Jezzails Smithing"
 bunderblusses_desc:0 "With our long rifles, the jezzails, we bring death and ruin to our foes. Yet these weapons are difficult to craft and costly to produce. We must seek new methods—ways to simplify their construction and ensure that our arsenals never fall silent."

 call_old_oaths_desc:0 "Many creatures of the old world were driven into the North and now eke out their existence in its caves, mountains, forests, and glaciers.

 vaetti_helper_title:0 "The Vaetti"
 vaetti_helper_desc:0 "The Vaetti are small, almost dwarf-like creatures who, throughout the ages, have often served at our side. Unlike the unruly trolls, the Vaetti are steadfast and reliable—qualities that make them worthy of respect. They know their place within the great order of the North, and many among them have earned renown in battle. They serve us chiefly as scouts and pathfinders, and at times as subterranean specialists or light infantry, swift and sharp-eyed in the wilds."
 awaken_draugr_title:0 "The Draugr"
 awaken_draugr_desc:0 "The Draugr are the Reawakened Ancestors — warriors who fell in ages long past, yet are summoned back by our magi to stand once more in defence of the homeland. These corpse-bound revenants, grim and tireless, move with a strength that outlasts even what they possessed in life. Devoid of fear and untouched by doubt, the Draugr march in unbroken silence, bound not by obedience but by ancient oaths and the echoes of a duty they swore before death claimed them."

 another_aggreement_with_werwolves_title:0 "Strike a Deal with the Werewolves"
 another_aggreement_with_werwolves_desc:0 "The werewolves of the North have declared their willingness to strike a pact with us. In exchange for spoils, they will lend us their strength and their sharpened claws. And since those spoils consist merely of the promise of flesh—an offer of little consequence to us—the bargain is hardly a difficult one to make. Thus, the pact is woven, sealed by hunger and ambition alike."
 let_them_eat_humans_title:0 "Let them Feast"
 let_them_eat_humans_desc:0 "Now the time has come for us to honor our share of the pact and grant the werewolves their portion of the spoils—spoils we have gathered in such abundance. It is only through this offering that the bond between us is strengthened, and the terms of our alliance woven ever tighter. Let them partake, as promised, in the bounty they helped us claim"
 our_trusted_spies_and_minions_title:0 "Our Trusted Spies"
 our_trusted_spies_and_minions_desc:0 "The werewolves now serve us as our eyes and ears, slipping into lands yet unconquered, prowling through the shadows as they sniff out secrets and gather vital knowledge. At home they do much the same, stalking through familiar forests and moonlit streets to root out those who would conspire against us from within. In silence and in darkness, they weave a web of information that strengthens our hold on every realm touched by our influence"
 the_horror_of_north_title:0 "The Unleashed Horror"
 the_horror_of_north_desc:0 "From the frozen North we have gathered countless nightmares and unleashed them upon the world. Creatures that should have been no more, yet have escaped the wrath of the gods themselves. Before us, fear and terror march as our vanguard, clearing the way for our dominion, and leaving only despair in the wake of their shadowed passage"
 organize_humans_title:0 "Enserf the Humans"
 organize_humans_desc:0 "The human will serve us as loyal serfs from now on, like the trolls, but with more autonomy, as they can be trusted much more. As they have enslaved each other this will not be a new concept to them, we just need to instituete this."
 issue_new_jarldoms_title:0 "Create new Jarldoms"
 issue_new_jarldoms_desc:0 "Our realm has grown vast beyond all expectations, stretching so far that we no longer have enough jarls to govern every territory. New jarldoms must be forged, and new jarls appointed to stand as stewards of our expanding dominion. Only then can order be maintained and our rising power continue its relentless march."
 strong_quatos_title:0 "Issues Harsh Taxes"
 strong_quatos_desc:0 "We must tax these lands as heavily as possible if we are to see our grand designs fulfilled. Let the people groan beneath the weight of tribute, for above all stands the glory of the Giants—radiant, unyielding, and beyond question"
 stratified_society_title:0 "Keep the Social Order"
 stratified_society_desc:0 "No matter what may come, the social order must remain intact. Above all stand the Giants, and beneath them our ancient allies—the Vaetti and the werewolves. Only after them come the humans, and at the very bottom the trolls. Within those ranks, shifts may occur, loyalties may change, but never shall any among them rise to command a Giant. Such a breach would defy the very fabric of the world itself."
