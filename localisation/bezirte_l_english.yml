 bezirte_way_of_blade_title:0 "Way of the Blade"
 bezirte_way_of_blade_desc:0 "While you were partying, I studied the blade. While you were having premarital sex, I mastered the martial arts. While you wasted your days at the gym in pursuit of vanity, I cultivated inner strength. And now that the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate, you have the audacity to call upon me?"
 bezirte_swordmaster_title:0 "Swordsmaster of Gassala"
 bezirte_swordmaster_desc:0 "The skill of the Swordmasters of Gassala is famed across the lands. Lords and nobles summon them to their courts, eager to learn the art of the blade from their hands. Yet for the Gassalians, swordsmanship is far more than a craft or a trade. To wield the blade is to embody the very spirit of Gassala—confident, elegant, and dangerous. The dance of steel is our language, the clash of swords our music. Every duel is not merely a contest, but a declaration of who we are: proud heirs of a tradition that no outsider can truly grasp."
 bezirte_fencing_title:0 "Gassalian Fencing"
 bezirte_fencing_desc:0 "In Gassala, every quarrel may be resolved through the art of the sword. Not only the noble houses, but even humble farmers and servants settle their disputes with steel in hand. Thus it is known across the land that contention seldom festers here, for the blade brings clarity where words fail. Yet this way of life is not without consequence. In foreign realms, where other customs hold sway, the Gassalian manner often leads to confusion and misunderstanding. Still, the lesson has been learned by all who dwell beyond our borders: the Gassalians are to be respected."
 a_lenient_government_title:0 "A lenient Government"

 bezirte_rightfull_governance_title:0 "A true government"

 bezirte_war_title:0 "The Bezirtan War"
 bezirte_war_desc:0 "It has taken long enough, but now we have settled the matter with Izette. Yet there are other paths… other possibilities. Why shouldn’t we be the ones to achieve greatness?

 bezirte_claim_title:0 "The Western Gassala Campaign"

 bezirte_unity_title:0 "Unifiy the people"
 bezirte_unity_desc:0 "In the north begins the marshland, and there dwell people who may seem strange to outsiders, yet they are Gassalans by their customs and by their tongue. They, too, belong to the greater whole. It is our duty to bring all Gassalans together—noble and commoner alike—under one banner, so that no tribe, town, or district stands apart. Only when we are united can we ensure the strength, security, and prosperity of our land. In this vision, every Gassalan, from the marshes to the heart of our cities, has a place, a voice, and a stake in the future of Gassala. Let no one claim exclusion, for the bonds of our people transcend distance, habit, and difference. Together, we shall rise as one nation, proud, disciplined, and indivisible."

 bezirte_ivory_art_title:0 "Gassalan Ivory Art"

 bezirte_capital_title:0 "A Capital for Gassala"
 bezirte_capital_desc:0 "The cities of Gassala have little to offer against the truly great metropolises of Numaria, Talaria, or the North. This is a shame, for our people are capable. Yet since that terrible day when we lost our unity, we have done little more than bicker among ourselves…"

Know this: I have already inscribed eternity."
 bezirte_poetry_title:0 "Gassalan Poetry"
 bezirte_poetry_desc:0 "In the halls of Gassalic culture, where weight is not burden but pride, the art of being is celebrated. Here, a person’s worth is measured not in haste or fleeting deeds, but in the depth of their presence, the calm of their movements, and the breadth of their heart. Gassalic festivals are dances of abundance: food is shared, laughter echoes, and every gesture carries meaning.In the temples of the Ancients, the body is honored as the vessel of the soul—grand, strong, unshakable. Wisdom is not rushed but nourished, like wine slowly ripening in the sun. Thus speaks Gassalic philosophy: He who rests within himself carries the world in his form."
 bezirte_printing_title:0 "Develop new printing techniques"
 bezirte_printing_desc:0 "In this wondrous age of rediscovery and learning, it becomes ever more necessary to uphold and promote the noble art of the printed word. For books and manuscripts are not mere vessels of information, but the very instruments by which knowledge, wisdom, and virtue traverse the bounds of time. Through the diligent cultivation of print, scholars and citizens alike may drink deeply from the fountains of antiquity, reflect upon the lessons of history, and illuminate the mind with the radiant light of reason. To neglect the press is to let the wisdom of ages fade into shadow, leaving the soul impoverished and the mind unarmed against ignorance. Therefore, let every patron of letters, every artisan of the press, and every seeker of truth labor to preserve and advance this sacred craft. For in fostering print, we enshrine the eternal dialogue of humankind, secure the immortality of thought, and ensure that the illumination of learning shall never be extinguished."
 bezirte_paper_production_title:0 "Expand Paper Production"
 bezirte_paper_production_desc:0 "In this age of enlightenment and inquiry, the demand for knowledge grows ever greater, and with it the need for the medium that bears it: paper. Without sufficient sheets upon which to inscribe the thoughts of philosophers, the discoveries of scientists, and the artistry of poets, the wisdom of our age risks being lost or confined to fleeting memory. Paper is the lifeblood of learning, the vessel of letters, and the bridge between minds and generations. To neglect its production is to hinder the dissemination of knowledge, to starve the presses, and to impede the flourishing of the arts and sciences. Thus it is imperative that we labor diligently to increase its supply—through invention, industry, and careful stewardship of our resources. Let workshops and mills rise, let craftsmen refine their art, and let the pages multiply, so that the written word may continue to enlighten, instruct, and endure. In fostering the production of paper, we ensure that the light of reason and creativity may shine ever brighter, touching the minds of countless generations yet to come."
 bezirte_literary_agenda_title:0 "Gassalan Literature"
 bezirte_literary_agenda_desc:0 "In the annals of human expression, the literature of the Gassalics shines with unparalleled brilliance, for it sings of honor, courage, and the dignity of the soul. Within their verses and chronicles, the deeds of heroes are immortalized, and the principles that elevate mankind are rendered eternal upon the page. To read Gassalic literature is to witness the tapestry of virtue: each tale a lesson in steadfastness, each poem a meditation upon duty and moral grandeur. Honor is not mere reputation, but the measure of a life well-lived, the reflection of integrity in thought and action, and the light by which one’s spirit may navigate the trials of existence. In the Gassalic canon, every word carries weight; every sentence is forged with purpose, as though the pen itself were consecrated to the noble pursuit of ethical excellence. To engage with their works is to partake in a communion with greatness, to be inspired to emulate the courage, wisdom, and honor that defines their people. Thus let all who seek enlightenment turn to the Gassalic texts, for there is no greater guide to the cultivation of virtue, nor more resplendent testament to the enduring power of honor."
