 built_the_merchants_quarter_title:0 "Build the Merchants Quarter"
 built_the_merchants_quarter_desc:0 "The merchants have petitioned for many years for a quarter to call their own, a place where their guilds may rise and their storerooms stand secure. We shall endorse this plan and allocate to them a section of the city."
 built_the_sailor_quiarter_title:0 "Build the Sailors Quarter"
 built_the_sailor_quiarter_desc:0 "When the tide brings sailors ashore, they swarm our streets and rattle the peace of our people. This will no longer be tolerated. We will carve from the city a single quarter for them—docks, taverns, and lodgings bound by our law—so well-provisioned and watchful that their footsteps need rarely wander beyond its gates. Let order reign; let the salt-bred men find their pleasures within the bounds we set and leave our neighborhoods untroubled."
 the_grand_harbour_title:0 "The Grand Harbour"
 the_grand_harbour_desc:0 "Garai hungers for a harbor worthy of its rising grandeur—a great haven carved into the coast, with docks strong enough for the heaviest warships and shipyards wide enough for the endless labor of our craftsmen. Here sollen Händler ihre Segel flicken, Kapitäne Ladung tauschen und die Kriegsschiffe unseres Volkes neue Kraft schöpfen. Wer Garai betritt, soll erkennen: Dies ist kein gewöhnlicher Hafen, sondern das Herz einer seefahrenden Macht."
 palace_of_garai_title:0 "The Palace of Onehundred Towers"
 palace_of_garai_desc:0 "The Eldar may boast of their Palace of a Thousand Doors, yet we shall raise one to eclipse even their legends: a Palace of One Hundred Towers, each rising like a spear of stone into the heavens. It shall stand upon the great cliff above our city, a crown of might and splendor, so that all who look upon it feel the weight of our wealth, our legacy, and our unchallenged authority."
 fortifiacte_the_island_title:0 "The Three Bastions and sixty Towers"
 fortifiacte_the_island_desc:0 "Garai is a jewel—brilliant, coveted, radiant upon the waves—yet even the finest pearl is encased within a hardened shell. So must it be for our island.To safeguard our home against all who might covet it, we shall raise three great bastions, each positioned to command sea and sky alike. Between and around them shall rise sixty watchtowers, their beacons ever burning, their garrisons ever vigilant.When this ring of stone and steel is complete, no fleet shall approach unchallenged, no raider shall set foot upon our shores. Garai will shine—beautiful, prosperous, and forever secure behind its unbreakable armor."
 brightesT_port_of_world_title:0 "Port of Worlds Desire"
 brightesT_port_of_world_desc:0 "Over the long years, the harbor of Garai has grown and transformed. Where once only humble fishing boats moored in the shallows, there now stretch broad canals, merchant halls, towering warehouses, and endless lines of docks. Yet even this is not enough. Garai must become the most envied city in the world— the greatest harbor ever built, the shining destination of every sailor who follows the call of the sea. We will deepen its waters so that even the grandest vessels may glide to its quays. We will raise new docks and wharves, each more splendid than the last, until the horizon itself seems forested with masts. We will line the canals with bustling markets and proud guildhouses, their banners fluttering in the salt-laden wind. And when the sun sets, a thousand lanterns will ignite along the waterfront, turning the harbor into a golden crown upon the darkening sea. Garai shall not merely be a port.It shall be a legend—a city of promise, prosperity, and wonder, whispered about in every tavern from one end of the world to the other."
 expand_fleet_title:0 "The Morning Fleet"
 expand_fleet_desc:0 "The fleet of the Dawn has served us faithfully through many trials, yet the seas demand ever greater strength. What we have is no longer enough. A new Armada of the Dawn must be raised—swift, disciplined, and forged for war.We shall construct proud warships, their hulls reinforced, their sails broad and bright like the rising sun. Each vessel will be crewed by seasoned sailors and hardened marines, ready to bring our will to every corner of the Girish Sea. When this new fleet takes to the waters, no rival shall doubt our command of the waves. Let the world know: At dawn, our banners rise, our keels cut the surf, and our dominance over the Girish Sea becomes unquestionable."
 institute_heritage_admirality_title:0 "Admiral Dynasties"
 institute_heritage_admirality_desc:0 "Captains and admirals were once highly decorated, battle-hardened men raised from the crews. But to command a fleet requires more than mere experience aboard a ship! One needs knowledge, training from youth — an education that can only take place within dynasties. Only a select few shall hold the rank of admiral and train their like."
 a_siloar_quote_title:0 "Sailor Draft"
 a_siloar_quote_desc:0 "A shortage of seamen plagues our fleets, and cowardice grows where duty should stand. Too many seek the easy comforts of merchant decks and avoid the hard glory of the war‑keel. This will end. By decree of the Council, every household shall give one son to the war navy. He will learn seamanship, steel his courage, and take his place among those who defend our shores and our honor. Let this be a command of survival and pride: from hearth to keel, the realm shall stand united—trained, ready, and unbowed."
 hire_foreign_sailors_title:0 "Hire Foreign Sailors"
 hire_foreign_sailors_desc:0 "Our drafts have strained the fabric of home — to draw more sons would risk tearing our communities. But the world beyond our shores teems with sailors who know rope and wind. Let our captains be empowered: every commander who ventures to foreign ports shall be granted funds to enlist stout seamen for our fleets. Bring them home as brothers; let their skill fill our decks and their courage serve our banners."
 rubiono_trade_post_title:0 "Trade Post of Rubino"
 rubiono_trade_post_desc:0 "Rubino, the western isle, holds the promise of a trading stronghold of unmatched potential. From its harbors, we may press our rivals in the spice trade and open gateways to new markets, by diplomacy or by force. Here, our merchants may thrive and our fleets project power, ensuring that all who sail these waters feel the reach of our ambition."
 telcontar_islands_company_title:0 "Telcontar Island Company"
 telcontar_islands_company_desc:0 "The Telcontars are a green archipelago, rich with bounty and promise. Merchants have already joined into a single company to govern their trade and administration. Let us fold these patriots into our military framework—place their enterprise under the aegis of the Watch and channel Garai’s capital and resources into the islands. From these shores our merchants and our banners will reach new seas; through organized rule and naval protection the archipelago will become a jewel in our crown."
 built_plantations_title:0 "Build Plantations"
 built_plantations_desc:0 "These green isles are rich and fruitful — and now they are ours. No longer shall their bounty lie unused while our coffers hunger. Bring down the forests, plant boundless rows of crop, and let the tills sing with coin! From timber to spice, from sugar to dye plants, every grove and glade shall be bent to the service of our people and our Watch. Let the islands pay for the greatness we forge."
 fleet_of_gira_is_title:0 "The Dawn Fleet"
 fleet_of_gira_is_desc:0 "The fleet of Garai, long known as the Fleet of the Dawn, for it sails with the first light of day, has waned in strength over the years. Once it was feared and revered across every sea, yet now it falls short of the power it must wield.We shall rebuild it. Every keel shall be reforged, every mast raised anew. The decks will once again teem with sailors, marines, and the beating heart of our naval might. Cannons will line the rails, sails will catch the wind like the wings of the rising sun, and the horizon itself will tremble at the sight of our armada. The Fleet of the Dawn will sail again, not merely as a collection of ships, but as a symbol of Garai’s dominion, of our reach, our will, and our unyielding resolve. Let the seas know that from the first light of day, our power rises unstoppable."
 other_islands_title:0 "The Black Islands Beckon"
 other_islands_desc:0 "The Black Isles defy our claim and spurn our authority—yet their defiance will not stand. We shall gather strength: fleets, fortresses, and the will of our people, until every shore there answers to our banner. Let every hammer fall, every keel be launched, and every standard be raised—the time has come to make the Black Isles bow."
 last_island_title:0 "The Eldarian Islands Call"
 last_island_desc:0 "The eastern Black Isles lie under the banner of the King of Eldar, his human subjects planting towns upon their shores. They speak a cousin of our tongue and keep many of our customs—nearly our kin, and yet pledged to another. This must not stand. Let it be known from cliff to reef: the Isles’ loyalty belongs with us. Their hands must serve our forges and their harbors fly our pennants, not the banners of the Thousand‑Door King. We will win their fealty—by honor, by trade, or by strength."
 take_eldar_coast_title:0 "Lure of the Eldarian Coast"
 take_eldar_coast_desc:0 "We hold the islands, yet beyond the combes and reefs lies the eastern coast — the rest of the realm, crowned by Eldar, the Jewel of the East. Their liege failed them, and witchmasters now stalk their streets. We cannot stand idle while sorcery and neglect rob the people of shelter. Let it be known: we shall move to rescue those lands from the war‑mages’ shadow and bind them to our standard. In saving them we claim not only territory, but duty — protection in exchange for fealty."
 witch_cost_long_title:0 "The Witch Coast"
 witch_cost_long_desc:0 "The Witch Coast is a place of shadow and whisper, a perilous shore where only the desperate or the foolish tread. No longer will we watch from afar while its darkness gnaws at our borders. We shall move with purpose: drive out the evil that festers there, cleanse the coves and headlands, and fold those beautiful coasts beneath our protection. For the safety of our people and the honor of the Watch, the Witch Coast will become ours—cleansed, guarded, and made whole."
 pestilenece_bay_title:0 "Secure the Bay of Pestilence"
 pestilenece_bay_desc:0 "Far to the south yawns the Bay of Pestilence—an accursed stretch of water that only the boldest captains dare to ply. And yet within its mists lies treasure: the great Gate into the Eastern Hexen Sea, a passage to markets and wonders beyond imagining. For such a doorway the price of risk is small. Let it be proclaimed: we will peer into the fog, map safe lanes, raise fortified posts along the approach, and tame the bay so that steady keels may pass. Where others fear to sail, our banners will ride the wave—and from that gate our fortunes will pour forth."
 tarach_outposts_title:0 "Outpost in Tarach"
 tarach_outposts_desc:0 "The Talach isles — and above all the Long Isle — stand like sentinels in the sea, strong in cliff and reef and simple to hold once our banners are raised. Make no mistake: from a single fortress there we will choke the trade of rival merchants and bend the spice‑routes to our will. Let the captains ready keel and the smiths temper steel: we shall take a foothold, crown it with our towers, and let every ship that passes know whose toll it pays."
 take_elwind_title:0 "Take Elwind"
 take_elwind_desc:0 "Elwind rises from the waves before the coast of Gelros like a hand waiting to grasp the horizon. It shall be ours. Let the captains cast off, let the banners fly at dawn: seize Elwind, raise towers upon its shores, and crown it with our garrisons. For the glory of Girai in the Sea, let this isle become a bastion of our power and a beacon to every mariner who sails our waters."
 hire_foreign_soldiers_title:0 "Hire foreign Soldiers"
 hire_foreign_soldiers_desc:0 "We cannot split our strength and expect to rule both sea and shore. The fleet is our destiny — let the keels cut the waves while others spill their blood for our cause. Gold is a tide that rises and falls; loyal men and subjects endure. Raise coin, hire blades from foreign ports, and let our banners ride the morning — the sea will be ours."
 a_royal_guard_is_title:0 "Institue Royal Guards"
 a_royal_guard_is_desc:0 "Mercenaries may fight for coin, but the shield of the realm must be forged from blood and oath. The Royal Guard shall rise from Garai’s oldest and truest houses—men and women of lineage, honor, and unwavering loyalty. Clad in the finest armor and schooled in discipline and tactics from youth, they will alone wear the crown of our trust. When foreign blades march for pay, our Guard will stand as the leash and the law: commanders of men, exemplars to the city, and the living bulwark that keeps chaos at bay."
 foreign_knowledge_of_all_title:0 "Use Foreign Knowledge"
 foreign_knowledge_of_all_desc:0 "Where foreign blades march, foreign wisdom follows. The mercenaries bring more than muscle — they bring crafts, tongues, and techniques that can strengthen our people. We will welcome useful customs, learn new arts, and fold foreign knowledge into the fabric of Garai. Let our forges take their methods, our schools teach their sciences, and our masters adapt the best of other worlds so that Garai grows wiser, richer, and more powerful."
 institute_mercenaries_office_title:0 "Institute a Mercenaries Office"
 institute_mercenaries_office_desc:0 "Hitherto our blades were bought by envoy and bargain—a slow, uncertain trade that bends our will to the whims of men. No more. We shall found a Ministry of Contracted Arms, a single iron office to raise, bind, and oversee hired companies. From this seat of power the bargain will be swift, lawful, and uniform. No wandering envoys, no scattered deals—only the Crown’s seal and the discipline of the state. Let coin buy loyalty only through order, and let the realm speak with one voice in matters of hired steel."
 siphon_new_world_trade_title:0 "Siphon new World Trade"
 siphon_new_world_trade_desc:0 "The eastern coasts hide treasures that would blind the unprepared eye—wealth beyond our dreams, waiting behind foreign flags and far ports. Let it be declared: we shall reach out and claim our portion. Send our ships, raise our banners, and let merchants and captains know that the spoils of eastern trade shall flow to our docks. Where others barter blind, we will take by guile, by pact, or by force—whatever secures Garai’s share of that glittering tide."
 control_direct_ports_title:0 "Control New World Ports"
 control_direct_ports_desc:0 "It is one thing to gather scraps from the trade of others; it is quite another to seize the feast itself. We shall not be content with crumbs washed ashore—our banners must fly over ports on the eastern coasts. There we will claim the harbors, control the docks, and let every shipment pass through our hands. From these bastions, the full wealth of the East will flow not in trickles, but in rivers of coin and goods, for Garai shall take the whole cake!"
 garai_far_away_title:0 "A New Garai"
 garai_far_away_desc:0 "Why be content with commerce alone when the East itself beckons? Beyond those harbors lie whole realms waiting to be claimed—lands to settle, fortresses to raise, and peoples to bind to our cause. Let our banners not only collect tolls, but fly from every hill and harbor; let us turn trade routes into roads of dominion and make the East our own."
 garai_trading_title:0 "Gira in the Trade"
 garai_trading_desc:0 "The Girish Sea’s trade is our birthright. Let no flag ply its lanes unchallenged—by law, by blockade, or by blade we will make these waters ours. Send our squadrons to the choke points, close the markets to rivals, and let every cargo that crosses these waves pay tribute to our docks. We will push other merchants from the lanes until only our pennants ride every tide."
 monopol_trade_title:0 "Monopolize the Trade"
 monopol_trade_desc:0 "In commerce as in courtship, only one may hold the heart. Let it be declared: the lanes of east and west shall answer to our prow. We will forge an unbroken chain from harbor to harbor so that no bale, no spice, no silken bolt crosses the seas without first bowing to our flag. Raise the banners of trade, tighten the ropes of law, and let every merchant know — henceforth the tide of goods belongs to us alone."
 monpoli_withc_title:0 "Expand Trade into the Witchlands"
 monpoli_withc_desc:0 "Let it be declared: our monopoly must reach across every tide and dune of the Witchlands. From northern coves to southern bays, every market and harbor will answer to our tolls and our standards. We will bind trade to our ports, bend rivals to our law, and make the Witchlandss a single artery of wealth that beats for us alone."
 rulers_of_trade_title:0 "Rulers of Trade"
 rulers_of_trade_desc:0 "We rule the commerce of both coasts — from the marshes of Gira to the bewitched headlands of the Witch Lands. Let every merchant know: our flags command the lanes, our tolls mark the price, and our fleets keep the sea. Where goods flow, our coffers grow; where ships sail, our law follows. We are the masters of trade on both sides."
 the_szegeni_route_title:0 "The Szegeni Route"
 the_szegeni_route_desc:0 "For countless years the Szegeni jealously guarded the hidden routes to Adam and Gelros, weaving myths and half-truths to keep all others away. But their secrecy has finally unraveled. We have charted the winds, mapped the reefs, and decoded every trick of the currents. Now the way lies open to us — and with it, the promise of wealth beyond measure. Where once only the Szegeni dared to sail, our ships will now cut through the waves, carrying home the riches they believed theirs alone."
 eastern_domination_title:0 "Eastern Domination"
 eastern_domination_desc:0 "Trade in the East belongs to us — by right, by strength, and by the mastery of our fleets. From the bustling quays of Broden to the distant shores of the New World, every deal struck, every cargo loaded, every coin exchanged moves within the reach of our power. Let all rivals know: the eastern winds carry our banners, and the markets rise and fall at our command."
 richest_nation_of_all_title:0 "Legendary Wealth"
 richest_nation_of_all_desc:0 "No one under the sun can rival the wealth of Girai’s people! Our coffers overflow, our markets glitter, and our ships return laden with treasures from every horizon. Let all who look upon Girai know: prosperity dwells here, and none surpass us in fortune or splendor."
