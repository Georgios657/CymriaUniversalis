He must now face our judgment. The chaos he unleashed upon the other provinces will not save him; his plots end here, and justice will be done."

 fire_born_events.1.desc:0 "The Fire-Born are stirring more fiercely than before, sowing chaos and devastation across the countryside. Where they pass, fields blacken and homesteads smolder; flocks and folk scatter before their wake. Patrols report fresh ash-streaked trails and ruined hamlets, and the tongues of flame leap higher with every night. We must marshal hunters and mages, reinforce the border watch, and answer the cry of the afflicted—lest the blaze consume more than land and harvest, but the very spirit of our people."

 the_fire_born_title:0 "The Fire-Born"
 the_fire_born_desc:0 "Born from the fiery mountains, the Fire-Born are an ever-present threat to life and limb. The farmers and settlers of the Black Mountains appease them with offerings and tributes, hoping to stave off their wrath. Yet such fragile peace cannot last forever. We must find a way to soothe the Fire-Born’s fury—at least until a true solution can be forged."
 errect_the_three_pillars_title:0 "Errect the Three Pillars"
 errect_the_three_pillars_desc:0 "The Fire-Born are the offspring of untamed fire spirits that rage within the heart of the volcanoes. By erecting pillars at three key locations, we may be able to harness and contain at least a fragment of the wild magic that surges through this land. If successful, it could weaken the storms of flame and reduce the number of Fire-Born wandering our realms."
 assemble_the_clegry_title:0 "Assemble the Clergy"
 assemble_the_clegry_desc:0 "Some within our faith believe the fire spirits to be gods—beings nearly as powerful as the Great Mother herself.Such claims are, of course, heresy. Yet the growing divide among the clergy cannot be ignored. We must summon all priests and guide them toward a single truth: the fire spirits are no gods, but demons—relentless foes that must be opposed without rest or mercy."
 prufying_flame_title:0 "Purifying Flame"
 prufying_flame_desc:0 "The brightest flame burns so fiercely that all impurity and evil are consumed—and so too shall the Fire-Born perish before it. Even they cannot withstand the Flame of Purity. Yet such a flame is not easily kindled. We must gather the most powerful fire mages of our realm in a grand conclave, and together weave a spell capable of banishing the Fire-Born—surely, and for all time."
 send_them_back_to_earth_title:0 "Send them back into the Earth"
 send_them_back_to_earth_desc:0 "After a long and arduous search, we have finally discovered their last hiding places—the fissures from which they crawled forth from the depths of the earth. Now we shall seal them, one by one, so that the Fire-Born may never again ravage our lands. Thus shall their blasphemy be silenced, and their heresy forever banished from the world."
 catch_the_trade_title:0 "Catch the Trade"
 catch_the_trade_desc:0 "The trade conducted in Arakeen is vast and serves as a strong foundation for our realm’s prosperity.After the long years of war and devastation, we must proclaim to all nations: the markets are open once more! Let it be known that our tariffs are light, and that commerce shall flow freely again through the gates of Arakeen."
 isla_robina_title:0 "Isle of Robin"
 isla_robina_desc:0 "The isle of Robin is the jewel of these waters — a wealthy treasury of the sea. We shall seize it and reclaim it for the Earth-Mother. From that stronghold we will gain not only access to vast riches, but also a crucial bridgehead from which to thwart any future invasions."
 banish_thallasor_title:0 "Cage Thallasor"
 banish_thallasor_desc:0 "The rogues of Thalassor embody many a repulsive trait — yet above all they are greedy and apostate, having cast the Great Mother from their hearts and preaching a false creed.They strive to block and undermine us at every turn. We must see to it that they are rendered powerless: their schemes exposed, their leaders unmasked, and their capacity to threaten our people broken so that they may never again imperil the realm."
 the_black_guard_title:0 "The Black Guard"
 the_black_guard_desc:0 "We wear our black skin with pride, for it is as dark and radiant as the sands of our homeland. The Black Guard stands among our finest warriors—clad in shadowed armor and midnight garb, bound by unshakable oath to the cause of our people. They will fight with unwavering courage, holding the line until their last breath, until strength itself abandons them—but never their resolve."
 expand_black_guard_title:0 "Expand the Black Guard"
 expand_black_guard_desc:0 "Once the Black Guard was but a small cadre — now it has grown larger than ever before. Wherever the call to arms sounds, warriors long to be counted among its ranks. Though many aspirants lack the full measure of skill, their fervor is itself a resource: the Guard’s ethos — discipline, sacrifice, and unshakable loyalty — can uplift our entire army. Let their example be the spark that forges every regiment keener, steadier, and truer to the cause."
 yatars_demise_title:0 "Yatars Demise"
 yatars_demise_desc:0 "Yatar stands at the crossroads of the continents — a bulwark that bars the route to the Central Sea and the Isthmus of Rheen. We must claim this land as our own to cement our position and shield Abyssia from foreign incursions. From Yatar’s heights we would command the sea lanes and the land approaches alike, projecting our power outward into every neighboring realm and turning any would-be invasion back upon itself."
 the_further_coast_title:0 "The Further Coast"
 the_further_coast_desc:0 "West of Yatar, the long coast stretches all the way to Arakeen. Once, the people of these lands worshipped the Great Earth—but new gods have risen, sowing discord and chaos in their wake. These realms now cry out for order, for a guiding hand to restore balance and protection. Their riches, too, are not to be overlooked—for the great forges of our nation ever hunger for fresh supplies and unending streams of ore and trade."
 kossor_fight_title:0 "Till the Far Cape"
 kossor_fight_desc:0 "In the far West lies the distant Cape — the very end of our homeland’s continent. Beyond it stretches the endless sea, reaching to the horizon and beyond. From there alone may new dangers come, for upon the land we have no enemies left to fear. We have subdued and tamed all the powers of northern Azar, bringing these lands under our dominion and securing them at last."
 defeat_pirates_title:0 "Defeat the Pirates"
 defeat_pirates_desc:0 "The pirates off the coast of the West Cape are a constant menace to our shores and to any trade that seeks to run from east to west. We must strike at their nests upon the isles—root them out, destroy their havens, and bring those lands to peace so that commerce may pass unhindered and our coasts be made safe."
 develop_arakeen_trade_title:0 "Develop the Arakeenian Trade"
 develop_arakeen_trade_desc:0 "War, strife, and general chaos have brought trade in Arakeen to a halt — yet it could be so much richer. We will steer it back onto orderly channels, reestablish markets and safe trade routes, and in doing so tighten our monopoly over these regions. With the wealth thus secured, we will mobilize the resources needed to fund our greater projects and fortify the realm’s future."
 the_grand_forge_title:0 "The Grand Forge"
 the_grand_forge_desc:0 "The great forge in our capital shall glow blood-red, for we prepare for war and are hammering arms and armor for our legions! Its fires will not be allowed to die until every man and woman is outfitted and every column ready to march. Night and day the anvils will ring, master-smiths and apprentices alike driven by a single purpose: to clothe our warriors in iron and steel so they may carry the will of the realm to every battlefield."
 citadel_of_fire_title:0 "Citadel of Fire"
 citadel_of_fire_desc:0 "Around Abyss rise countless volcanoes—mountains that belch flame and ash. We will raise a new, impregnable fortress, and we have chosen to place it directly atop one of those fire-spewing peaks. Seers and oracles will reveal which summit is most suited; once chosen, we will hew foundations into living rock, fashion ramparts of obsidian and tempered steel, and crown the stronghold where fire meets ash. There it will stand as a bulwark against our enemies—born of flame, unbowed by flame."
 the_greatest_forge_title:0 "The Greatest Forge"
 the_greatest_forge_desc:0 "The forges of Abyss must grow—far beyond their present needs. We will outfit still more armies and hammer yet more steel; our foundries must swell to meet that demand. Erect more furnaces, raise more bellows; lay down new lines of smelting and smithing so that iron and fire may never run short. The workers will labor day and night, bellies hollow and hands blistered, yet every heated stroke, every ringing anvil will be worth the price—each blade and breastplate a promise that our people shall stand strong. Raise the forges. Stoke the flames. Let the roar of industry drown out the whisper of our enemies."
 the_grand_fire_mountains_title:0 "The Grand Fire Mountains"
 the_grand_fire_mountains_desc:0 "The ring of fire-mountains that girds our homeland has always been a relentless torment—yet it is also an opportunity. Their heat does more than scorch the land; it can liquefy iron and steel. We will harness the furnace of the earth itself to drive our forges: tapping volcanic heat to boil water, turn engines, and power bellows so that molten metal flows and anvils never fall silent. From the fury of the mountains we will draw the very flames that arm our people."
 eternal_abyssian_fire_title:0 "Eternal Fire"
 eternal_abyssian_fire_desc:0 "The eternal fires of our homeland power every great forge—but they also burn within our hearts. We are black of skin because the heat of our land once scorched and seared us, marking us forever with the touch of flame. And we are proud of it—for we are the Fire-Born people. From the mountains of ash and molten stone we rose, tempered and hardened like steel. There is no challenge our kind will not face, no trial we will not overcome. The fire that forged our bodies also forged our spirit—and it shall never die."
 asaes_call_title:0 "Asaes Call"
 asaes_call_desc:0 "Asae Ya, Goddess of the Earth, Mother of all lands, Creator of the seas, calls to us without ceasing. She bids us to free her sacred soil from all foreign hands and to restore it to the reverence it once commanded. Her voice stirs our hearts, guiding our deeds, and demanding that the Earth itself be honored, protected, and elevated above all else."
 grand_earthen_mother_title:0 "Grand Earthen Mother"
 grand_earthen_mother_desc:0 "The Great Mother of the Earth has left countless sacred sites, where her will can be felt and her blessing sensed. We must secure these places and raise our temples upon them, to honor her and bestow the love and devotion she so rightly deserves. Each shrine shall stand as a beacon of reverence, a testament to her enduring presence, and a sanctuary where the faithful may draw strength and guidance."
 the_old_realm_of_faith_title:0 "The Old Realm"
 the_old_realm_of_faith_desc:0 "Once, the Word of Asae was honored everywhere—from Pyrrenor in the East to Velran in the West, from Ilthar to Seelen. Now it is little heeded, its wisdom neglected and its power forgotten. We will restore it, spreading the Word once more across the lands, step by step, until every corner of the realm feels its presence and bends in reverent obedience."
 a_thousands_golems_title:0 "A thousands Golems"
 a_thousands_golems_desc:0 "Golems, fashioned from the sacred clay of Asae, imbued with her holy power and soul by our magi, stand as the pinnacle of magical and religious union—a living testament to our faith. Others might use such beings merely as engines of labor or instruments of war, but we honor them differently. We give them temples to guard, sanctuaries to watch over, and sacred spaces to tend and protect. In their vigilance, the spirit of Asae endures, and her blessing is made manifest through stone and soul."
 eternal_worship_of_asae_title:0 "Eternal Worship of Asae"
 obj_convert_1000_provinces_tooltip:0 "Convert 1000 provinces"
 eternal_worship_of_asae_desc:0 "The Word of Asae now holds sway once more wherever it was once honored, and none shall dare to disregard the Great Mother. We stand exalted as her most devoted disciples, yet we seek no worldly reward. Her love alone has been sufficient recompense, filling our hearts with purpose, guiding our hands in all deeds, and sanctifying our lives with the fire of devotion."
 deal_with_gira_title:0 "Deal with Gira"
 deal_with_gira_desc:0 "The Gira dwell in the low coastal lands — a people of the littoral marshes and estuaries. We must either bring them to heel or win them as allies; each course has its advantages and its perils. Yet make no mistake: whether by oath or by sword, their capacity to threaten our shores must be broken. Let envoys test for friendship where possible, but let our commanders be ready to strike where diplomacy fails. In the end, the Gira must no longer stand as a danger to our realm — they must be subdued, bound to our will, or folded into the order we restore across the coasts."
 badland_coast_title:0 "Coast of the Badlands"
 badland_coast_desc:0 "Beyond the Near Sea lie the vast Badlands — barren wastes where little life stirs. We must establish strong outposts there to secure the scarce minerals and ores that can be found only in those wastes. These stations will staff mines, guard the routes, and serve as forward hubs from which our engineers and caravans can harvest the earth’s hidden wealth, turning desolation into resource and strengthening the realm’s supply chains."
 into_the_badlands_title:0 "Rulers of the Badlands"
 into_the_badlands_desc:0 "We have established our first outposts; from these footholds we shall bring the rest of the Badlands to heel to continue protecting the Earth-Goddess. From these forward bases we will push westward into Cassa, binding together all of Asae’s children beneath one banner. Let these stations be the seeds of conquest and care—garrisons that guard the mines, sanctuaries that honor the Earth-Mother, and staging grounds from which our caravans and legions will carry soil, ore, and faith into every corner of the realm."
 cassa_fight_title:0 "Contact Cassa"
 cassa_fight_desc:0 "The lords of Cassa have renounced the true faith and pledged themselves to the Moon Goddess — a grave mistake. Yet hope remains: many of the farmers and common folk still carry the Great Earth in their hearts. We shall reach out to them with priests and envoys, rekindle ancient rites, and show the people the old, righteous way. Where persuasion fails, stern justice must follow — the ruling houses will be stripped of influence and the faithful restored to their rightful place."
 cassas_wealth_title:0 "Wealth of Cassa"
 cassas_wealth_desc:0 "Cassa was long blessed with abundant gifts from Mother Earth, and its life as a trading city only multiplied that wealth. Now that bounty will flow into Abyss — a tide of riches that will illuminate our people, strengthen our coffers, and enrich the commonweal. With these resources we shall fuel our forges, bolster our legions, and spread the prosperity of the Earth-Mother across the realm."
 all_eyes_tower_title:0 "All Eyes Tower"
 all_eyes_tower_desc:0 "The Tower of Far Sight — the Tower of Three Eyes — was first raised by an oracle of old, shaped from the sacred clay of Mother Earth to watch the paths of the tides and to glimpse the threads of fate. Today, the Navigator’s Guild of Cassa resides within its halls, guiding ships and charting stars. They may remain — but only if they swear fealty to the Great Mother. Let their eyes no longer serve the cold light of the Moon, but the warm and steadfast gaze of the Earth, whose wisdom first gave the tower purpose."
 cassian_city_culture_title:0 "Cassian City Culture"
 cassian_city_culture_desc:0 "The people of Cassa were once the first great nation among the disciples of the Earth, building their cities long before they turned to false faiths. From the ruins and remnants of their ancient works we may learn much — their mastery of stone, their harmony with the land, their sense of sacred order. Upon these old foundations we shall raise new cities, guided by the wisdom of the past and blessed by the Great Mother’s hand, so that her dominion may flourish again in strength and beauty."
 a_new_race_of_man_title:0 "A New Race of Man"
 a_new_race_of_man_desc:0 "The fusion of the mountains’ hard resolve, the forges’ living fire, the ancient culture of Cassa, the wisdom born of the Badlands, and the salt-taught folk of the near coast—this will forge a new kind of people. They will carry new perspectives, new hopes, and new dreams. Let that be our aim. We shall sweep away the worn and failing notions of old and, from their ashes, craft fresh cultures that are truer to our vision and stronger for the ages."
 gold_of_naguno_title:0 "Gold of Naguno"
 gold_of_naguno_desc:0 "In Naguno we have found no gold, yet silver and other precious ores lie hidden beneath its soil. We must encourage and expand production here, for these veins of wealth will help sustain our designs and finance the greater vision of our realm. Let new mines be dug, smelters raised, and trade routes secured, so that the lifeblood of silver may flow freely toward Abyss and fuel the future we are forging."
 holy_smithes_title:0 "Holy Smithing"
 holy_smithes_desc:0 "The act of forging is, for us, a sacred one.All priests should know the craft of the hammer and the anvil, and those who cannot forge must at least bless the forges and sanctify the work of those who do. For upon this art our land and our culture stand firm. The shaping of iron and copper is the foundation of our civilization—of both our prosperity and our strength in war. To forge is to pray; to temper metal is to honor the Great Mother’s heart, from whose depths all ore is born." 
 heat_forges_title:0 "Heat Forges"
 heat_forges_desc:0 "The forges must be kept burning! We must gather ever more fuel—whether coal or timber matters little. The fires must roar without pause. We have plenty of ore ready to be shaped; now we need only enough fire to bring it to life. Let every hearth blaze, every furnace roar, and every bellows pump unceasingly, for in the heat of these flames our strength, our arms, and the future of our people are forged."
 abyssian_steel_title:0 "Abyssian Steel"
 abyssian_steel_desc:0 "We do not merely produce iron weapons — in recent years we have also pioneered novel refining and tempering methods that have granted our metal unprecedented strength and reliability. This new Abyssian steel is now the talk of the realms, a marvel of forgecraft that will harden our legions and steel them against every challenge. With blades and breastplates wrought from this metal, our armies will stand firmer, strike truer, and carry the weight of our will into every battle."
 feed_the_fires_title:0 "Feed the Fires"
 feed_the_fires_desc:0 "The fires swell and spread—an ever-hungry blaze. There is an unending demand for fuel, and we must sate it. Coal, timber, peat—every hearth and furnace must be supplied without pause. Marshal the woodcutters and coal-bearers, secure new fuel veins, open trade routes and storehouses: let no kiln die for lack of kindling, no forge falter for want of coals.Only by feeding these flames can our forges forge onward, our forges arm our legions, and our realm be forged in fire."
 the_iron_fist_title:0 "The Iron Fist"
 the_iron_fist_desc:0 "The Iron Fist bestows upon us strength — the iron fist of rifles and cannons. It grants us standing, it grants us liberty, and it grants us renown. We will produce as many weapons as are needed to achieve our aims, and our forges shall never fall silent. Night and day the anvils will ring, the foundries will belch smoke, and the iron will be shaped into tools of power until our purpose is fulfilled."
 embrace_naval_identiy_title:0 "Embrace a Naval Identity"
 embrace_naval_identiy_desc:0 "The wide lands we now rule include long coasts inhabited by seafolk — a way of life strange and distant to us mountain-born. Yet the wealth of the sea is real and irresistible. We must change our outlook: create ministries, appoint officers, and build administrations that will teach us to govern harbors, raise fleets, and manage maritime trade. New ports, customs houses, and naval academies will bind the coasts to our realm and turn the ocean’s harvest into steady treasure for Abyss."
 look_to_the_south_title:0 "Look to the South"
 look_to_the_south_desc:0 "South of our mountains lie swamps and ranges — wild, unknown lands where who knows what secrets hide. What mysteries brood in those fen and highlands we cannot yet say; only that they stand beyond our sight and beyond our law. They must be brought low and put to work for the Mother—subdued, settled, and made to yield their hidden wealth. Let our banners move into the marshes and fold the lonely heights into our stewardship; let forts and farms follow, and let the wilderness be turned into order and resource for the realm."
 black_destiny_title:0 "Black Destiny"
 black_destiny_desc:0 "It is our destiny — the destiny of the Black People — to conquer and master the South. From the pages of the Book of Qalumhara to the furthest southern Cape, our dominion shall extend. Let banners be raised, legions march, and laws be laid down under our hand; so shall the southern lands be folded into the order and glory of our realm."
 the_great_burning_jungles_title:0 "The Great Burning Jungle"
 the_great_burning_jungles_desc:0 "The vast forests of the southern jungle are the perfect fuel we require to stoke our eternal fires. We will fell those primeval woods and send their trunks by ship to feed our forges and furnaces, that no anvil cool and no kiln go dark. Let logging camps rise at the tree-line, convoys of barges and lighters carry the timber, and watchful garrisons guard the ways — for in the heat of these flames our forges are fed and our people made strong."
 kill_morn_title:0 "Kill the Scholars"
 kill_morn_desc:0 "The Disciples of Sorrow — as they call themselves today — are a loathsome brood of utterly unscrupulous and unhinged female mages, whose relentless experiments put all life at risk.They have once before unleashed death and demons upon the world, and given enough time they will surely do so again. Their twisted studies are an affront to the Earth-Mother and a danger to every living thing. They must be stopped: their laboratories shuttered, their blasphemous rites quashed, and their malignant craft rooted out so that peace and safety may return to the realm."
