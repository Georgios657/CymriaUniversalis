 the_matter_of_administratition_title:0 "Matter of Administration"
 the_matter_of_administratition_desc:0 "In these times of growing kingdoms, when lords and cities multiply in strength and trade flows across the land, it is no longer sufficient for a sovereign to rely solely upon the loyalty of barons and the counsel of a few courtiers. A realm that aspires to endure must rest upon firmer foundations: a bureaucracy both wide and deep. The collection of taxes, the keeping of records, the judging of disputes, the raising of armies, and the provision of roads and markets—all these demand more than noble goodwill. They demand men of letters, scribes trained to inscribe the truth, and officials bound by oath to the crown rather than to their kin. Where such order is lacking, corruption takes root, revenues vanish into private coffers, and the justice of the king becomes but a shadow."
 expand_the_buero_title:0 "Expand the bureaucracy"
 expand_the_buero_desc:0 "Bureaucracy is no enemy of nobility, but its ally. For when the burdens of administration are borne by clerks and ministers, the lords may devote themselves to war and governance of their lands without falling into petty quarrels over law or coin. Moreover, a well-tended bureaucracy binds the far corners of the realm to the throne, ensuring that the word of the sovereign is heard in every village and every castle, as swiftly and as firmly as if he himself had spoken it. Thus let it be said: a realm without bureaucracy is a body without sinew—rich in promise, yet weak in strength. But a realm with ordered offices and faithful clerks is like unto a mighty host, ready to endure the ages."
 provnicial_governments_title:0 "Provincial Government"
 provnicial_governments_desc:0 "The strength of a kingdom lies not only in the valor of its knights nor in the riches of its merchants, but in the order with which its lands are ruled. Too long have distant provinces depended solely upon the slow hand of the crown, and in that distance confusion and discord have often taken root. Therefore, by wisdom and necessity, let it be declared: each province shall be entrusted to a royal governor, chosen by the king and sworn in loyalty to his throne. These governors shall safeguard the peace, collect the rightful dues, and administer the law in the name of the sovereign. In times of peril they shall rally the levies of their provinces; in times of plenty they shall tend to the growth of trade and the welfare of the people. Such appointments shall not diminish the dignity of the lords, but rather strengthen it, for the governor is the servant of order, ensuring that justice flows and that the commands of the crown do not falter on the long road from capital to countryside. Thus shall the realm be knit more closely together, province to province, village to village, until no border nor distance may weaken its unity. In this way, with governors as the eyes and hands of the king, the kingdom shall endure as one body, firm and unshaken."
 full_control_of_delegates_title:0 "Full control of Delegates"
 full_control_of_delegates_desc:0 "Let it be known throughout the realm: the crown is the fountain of law, the shield of the weak, and the guardian of peace. By its authority the kingdom stands united; without it, all would fall to ruin and strife. Therefore every lord, knight, priest, and common man alike is bound by sacred duty to render loyalty unto the sovereign. For from the crown flow justice and protection, and to the crown must flow obedience and service. Such is the bond that holds the realm together, and such is the order decreed by Heaven itself. Let none imagine that their strength or station releases them from this solemn oath. The fields yield their harvest only in peace, the markets flourish only under law, and the sword is mighty only when wielded in rightful service to the king. To betray the crown is to betray the land, the people, and the future. Thus we proclaim: all men owe their faith and loyalty to the throne, for in that loyalty rests the life of the kingdom, and in that unity rests its glory."
 direct_rule_from_arno_title:0 "Direct Rule from Arno"
 direct_rule_from_arno_desc:0 "By the unchallenged will of the Emperor, sovereign above all crowns, it is decreed: from this day forth, every province of the Empire shall be governed directly from the Imperial Capital of Arno. The days of divided councils and the quarrels of local lords are at an end. From Arno, the throne of the Emperor, flows the source of law, justice, and authority. No land shall claim exemption, no province stand apart, for all are bound together beneath the aegis of the Imperial Crown. Let it be known to all subjects: the Empire is one body, and the Emperor its head. As light radiates from the sun, so too does the Emperor’s command reach every corner of the realm, uniting all peoples in loyalty, obedience, and shared destiny. Thus unity is forged, discord extinguished, and the majesty of the Empire made everlasting."

 annex_cattri_desc:0 "By decree of His Imperial Majesty, the ancestral duchy of Catricolle is henceforth restored to the embrace of the Empire. From this day, it shall be governed directly from the Imperial Capital of Arno, and no longer stand apart in divided rule. Yet in recognition of the noble blood that has long safeguarded Catricolle, the kinsmen who bore its banner shall not be cast aside. Instead, they shall be honored with positions at the Imperial Court, where their service shall be to the Empire entire, not to a province alone. Thus the bonds of kinship are renewed, the strength of the Empire enlarged, and Catricolle returned to its rightful place beneath the eternal crown."
 new_posiitons_in_court_title:0 "New Positions in Courts"
 new_posiitons_in_court_desc:0 "It is the will of His Imperial Majesty that the great lords of the realm shall henceforth be drawn ever closer to the Throne. To this end, new offices and dignities shall be granted at the Imperial Court in Arno, whereby the nobility may render their service not as distant rulers, but as counselors and stewards beneath the direct gaze of the Crown. Thus shall their loyalty be strengthened, their ambitions tempered, and their honor magnified in the service of the Empire entire. For in unity with the Throne lies the true greatness of the realm, and the nobility shall find both glory and purpose within the halls of Imperial power."
 depower_normal_nobles_title:0 "Depower normal nobles"
 depower_normal_nobles_desc:0 "By command of His Imperial Majesty, let it be known that the scattered privileges of the rural nobility are henceforth abolished. No longer shall petty lords cling to ancient rights that weaken the unity of the realm. From this day forth, only those noble houses rooted in Arno, and in the loyal Crownlands, shall be elevated to positions of honor and trust within the Imperial Court. They alone shall share in the governance of the Empire, as they alone have proven steadfast in their fidelity to the Throne. Let all others understand: the strength of the Empire lies not in divided privilege, but in the singular will of the Crown."

 all_nobles_are_lichian_desc:0 "By the authority of His Imperial Majesty, let it be proclaimed: henceforth, all positions of honor and governance within the Imperial Court shall be reserved exclusively for members of the Emperor’s own family. No house, however noble, may claim office or influence at court unless bound by blood to the imperial line. This decree ensures the undivided loyalty of those who serve, and secures the unity and strength of the Empire under the sovereign will of the Throne. Let all subjects and nobles alike understand: the glory and governance of the Empire belong solely to the family of the Emperor, and obedience to this order is absolute."
 institue_legal_objections_title:0 "Institute legal objections"
 institue_legal_objections_desc:0 "By the command of His Imperial Majesty, let it be known that henceforth all subjects of the Empire may present their petitions and objections directly to the Emperor and his appointed officials. No intermediary shall stand between the people and the Throne; the authority of distant lords or local nobles may not impede the voice of the citizen or the grievance of the vassal. All matters of complaint, appeal, or request may be submitted to the imperial bureaucracy, and shall receive due consideration under the direct supervision of the Emperor’s representatives. This measure ensures that loyalty and justice are directed to the Crown alone, bypassing the ambitions or prejudices of provincial nobility, and strengthens the unity of the Empire under the sovereign authority of His Imperial Majesty."

All local governance, taxation, and military organization shall now answer directly to the Emperor and his appointed officials, leaving no authority in the hands of hereditary lords. Let it be known: the Duchy of Lor shall serve as the foundation of the Empire’s northern campaign, and all actions therein shall be carried out in the name and for the glory of the Imperial Throne."

These territories, once free and unbound, are now to serve the greater purpose of the Empire, providing strength, resources, and unity to the realm. All armies, governors, and officials are to act under the direct mandate of the Throne, ensuring that Virtaya’s subjugation contributes fully to the glory and prosperity of the Empire of Humanity. Let all subjects understand: the northern lands shall no longer stand apart, but shall rise as a part of our unified Empire, loyal to the Emperor and devoted to the service of humanity."

 the_witch_doctors_desc:0 "By the authority of His Imperial Majesty and for the safety of all subjects of the Empire, let it be proclaimed: the cabals of witch‑doctors dwelling in the southern reaches are to be considered enemies of the realm. Their arts sow pestilence, superstition, and lawlessness; they endanger the commonwealth and undermine the peace the Crown is sworn to preserve. Therefore, the Emperor commands that these cabals be sought out, their strongholds overcome, and their powers broken. The lands they occupy shall be occupied and governed by imperial garrisons and trusted administrators until order and loyalty to the Crown are fully restored. All who surrender and renounce the forbidden rites shall be afforded mercy in accordance with imperial law; those who continue in their rebellion shall be subdued by force. Let the governors, generals, and magistrates of the realm marshal their men and resources to this end. By this decree the security of the people and the unity of the Empire are made the highest law.

From its halls shall emerge officers dedicated not to clan or province, but to the Empire and the Crown. The cadet branch of Catricolle shall be placed under direct oversight of the Ministry of War and remain accountable to the Emperor’s generals, ensuring that its graduates are bound by oath and service to the Throne.

The unification of currency is ordained to strengthen trade, stabilize markets, ensure equitable taxation, and consolidate the economic power of the Crown.
