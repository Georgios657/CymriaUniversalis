 monte_negro.1.t:0 "Visitors in the Tower"
 monte_negro.1.desc:0 "A group of strangers has wandered into our city and entered our tower, led by the annoying guardian spirit of the dead emperor… futilely searching for the knowledge hidden here. We could destroy them without any trouble, but this would disrupt our concentration and give Nefara, our unwelcome tenant, a chance to rise in rebellion..."
 monte_negro.1.a:0 "They will die on their own"
 monte_negro.1.b:0 "Smite them!"
 monte_negro.2.t:0 "Visitors persist"
 monte_negro.2.desc:0 "Our unwelcome guests are growing bolder and have pushed further into the tower, where they have encountered Nefara. Surely, they have conspired against us—but what can they possibly accomplish against our immense power?"

 monte_negro.3.t:0 "The Fight in the Topchamber"
 monte_negro.3.desc:0 "With swift strides and bold hearts, the heroes rushed to the top level of the tower and, through their ritual, summoned Telcontar from the distant East. He seized the wicked sorcerer Cato—apostate and thief—and devoured him despite his immortality. Now, it is time to return the city of Monte Negro to the light… so I swear, as Nefara, Guardian of this Library."

 monte_negro.4.t:0 "The lost hunter"
 monte_negro.4.desc:0 "A lone hunter from the West has wandered into our city and our tower… He carries strange weapons and does not resemble anyone we have ever seen before.

And I will take his knowledge—whether he wills it or not."

 monte_negro.5.t:0 "A Witchmaster"
 monte_negro.5.desc:0 "A Lovian sorcerer has entered our city! Surely, Telcontar has sent him to do his dirty work. He could pose a threat to us… but we could also simply trust that he will never find us in the vastness of the tower. Killing him would take considerable effort—effort better spent on learning…"
 monte_negro.5.a:0 "He will never find me"
 monte_negro.5.b:0 "You die NOW"
 
 monte_negro.6.t:0 "A meeting"
 monte_negro.6.desc:0 "We underestimated the sorcerer. He has allied himself with Nefara, the true mistress of the tower, and with his power, he has broken ours… As we tried to scatter into a thousand flies and flee, Nefara raised her hand, and with a mighty gust of wind, she forced us back together—only for the sorcerer to trap us in an enchanted pouch. Surely, he intends to take us back to Lovien…"

 monte_negro.7.t:0 "A northern witch"
 monte_negro.7.desc:0 "New visitors in the tower! A witch from the distant north and her companions… We will soon learn what they seek: a way to lift the land’s curse and free the emperor. This is something we cannot allow. Besides, the blood of a magically gifted maiden would be quite useful to us… But for that, Cato would have to leave his study. And what could such worms possibly do against him, the master of the dark arts?"

 monte_negro.7.b:0 "A worthwile research subject"
 
 monte_negro.8.t:0 "A suprise"
 monte_negro.8.desc:0 "How could this have happened? These barbarians, incapable of even reading proper books, have found a way to banish us? We should have dealt with them—and with Nefara—much sooner. That wretched, small-minded fool aided them. Have they not seen the importance of our work here?"

When the Poltians utterly defeated the Zephyrians in the Battle of the Gelonian Plains 2,200 years ago, they also slew the Phoenix King, Eitan IV, and took his shield—forged by the legendary Bringer of Civilization. It is an artifact of immense power, a reminder of glorious victories and wars."

 monte_negro.12.desc:0 "Countless spoils of war from the ancient conflicts are displayed in Polita's palace.

The crown of the Politian Empire is certainly not the most beautiful crown in the world, but it was worn by many wise emperors and is undoubtedly a symbol of stability. The fact that we have now found it proves that our cause is just."
 monte_negro.12.a:0 "A Crown fitting for my head"
 
 monte_negro.13.t:0 "Emperor Jolien"
 monte_negro.13.desc:0 "Since we have ruled in Polita, the ghost of Emperor Jolien has continued to haunt us, trying to disrupt our rule. But in death, as in life, he remains a fool. Now, we have cast him into a dark pit, surrounded it with salt, and sealed him away forever."
