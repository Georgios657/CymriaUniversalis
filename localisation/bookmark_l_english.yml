 SHADOW_EMPIRE:0 "Shadow of the Empire"
 SHADOW_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "The Empire of Humanity is the greatest realm ever wrought in the history of men, its power felt far beyond its borders. Yet such might does not stand unchallenged—already, rival realms stir against it, seeking to defy its dominion…"
 HARPIA:0 "Blood and Feathers"
 HARPIA_DESC:0 "The Harpies have, somehow, emerged victorious in the war for Broden—yet their unity lies in ruins. Will the warlords succeed in regaining their strength swiftly enough, or will the vengeance of humankind drive them once more into the sea?"
 EDGE_OF_WORLD:0 "Worlds Edge"
 EDGE_OF_WORLD_DESC:0 "Here, at the very edge of the known world, remnants of the old still endure—both wonders and terrors alike. In these frozen, desolate lands and shadowed, primeval forests dwell creatures unlike men, alien and ancient. And here, they are hunted. Few are the brave peoples who have ever dared to venture into this place, and many among them have lived to regret it."
 ALMOSASZRA:0 "The Kingdom of the Sun"
 ALMOSASZRA_DESC:0 "The Holy Realm of the Sun, Almodoszra, now stands upon the threshold of a new age of war and strife, as the King’s power wanes and his grip upon the realm begins to falter. At this crossroads of destiny, a grave question is set before all peoples of the kingdom: will their common faith and shared history suffice to hold the realm together, or shall the quarrels of the past once more be opened, sundering that which the Son of the Sun so mightily wrought?"
 BRODEN:0 "Ruins of Broden"
 BRODEN_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Broden lies in ruins since the harpies emerged from the mountains, bringing death and destruction. The last remaining forces of the kingdom have retreated westward, where they received reinforcements from the Empire of Humanity. The armies now march toward the final battle on the winter fields of Brodenfield, where fate will be decided..."
 SEVEN_CITIES:0 "The Seven Cities"
 SEVEN_CITIES_DESC:0 "The Seven Great Cities are the centers of civilization in the lands between the Qareli and the Separating Sea. Led by Viscari, they are ancient rivals and youthful friends, for they are united by much more than they are divided by—not a common language, but the power of the sun and their city councils. Further to the west lies the Kingdom of Almodosaszra, which once promised Viscari eternal privileges, for it is the founder of the empire that originated from that city. Farther to the east, beyond the long road, lies the ancient and venerable city of Bescil, before the lands of the wild—barbaric—tribes of the Kaliner begin."
 MEDITERANE:0 "The Great Mediterane"
 MEDITERANE_DESC:0 "The vast Mediterranean Sea has seen several empires come and go. The last one left behind the free traders—the lands of Thallasor, Arakeen, and Cassa—who have sworn an eternal oath to pay their tribute. In the center lies the fertile island of Robin, almost entirely divided among the traders. Along the western channel lie the lands of Khossor, the realm of the evil witch queens, always in search of more power and more knowledge."
 TWIN_RIVER:0 "Twin-River Lands"
 TWIN_RIVER_DESC:0 "The rivers Seleen and Tabac are the lifelines for the great empires of the Two-River Land. Here, great empires rise; here, they fall. Colossal temples are erected and secret cults are founded. Here lies the universe, the center of everything. The kings of the universe rule from souls, yet the warrior-kings of Assay are already challenging them. Far to the north is the Kingdom of Mino, cursed to become beastmen and trapped in the eternal struggle between beastliness and humanity."
 HIGH_NORTH:0 "High-Up-North"
 HIGH_NORTH_DESC:0 "In the far north, the land of eternal winter and high ice, little life endures… Rumors swirl about the city of Obegin, carved into the slopes of a fire mountain, a place of dark rituals where blood flows in torrents. But even more whispers speak of the lands further north, where no living being should be able to survive… These tales tell of the Varjorjen, demons from the ancient times, hunting across the eternal ice, always in search of more flesh and blood. Legends speak of their immortal leaders—names like Yutu, the Eternal Marshal, and Akna, the Ever-Beautiful."
 QARELI:0 "The High Qareli"
 QARELI_DESC:0 "The Qareli, the Roof of the World, stretch from the High North to the Deep South, forming an almost impenetrable barrier for most. Here, the powerful trade lords of the high plateau rule alongside the dragon kings and their descendants."
 THE_DAWNING_ELF:0 "Dawn of Elfs"
 THE_DAWNING_ELF_DESC:0 "The Elves, children of the underworld, were sent to Earth by the goddess Morrigan with sacred missions. They appeared in the halls of the Mountain King and on the island of Ys. Others rebelled and fled into the distant desert to the east, where the jinn once lived. Together, they all claim to be the first of their kind, establishing their very own realm."
 CYMRIA_AND_NORTH:0 "Cymria and the North"
 CYMRIA_AND_NORTH_DESC:0 "The valleys of Cymria have long been forgotten by the wider world, ruled by countless warring clans. Yet, some now seek to unite the lands—the greatest city, Colone, and even the ageless sorceress ruler of Cymria, Anapura. For times are changing in the green valleys, as the tribes from the north push ever further south."
 THE_OLD_EMPIRE:0 "Dust and Echos"
 THE_OLD_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "The remnants of the old empire of Politia are a dusty wasteland devoid of life. Ruins stand in solitude, and an eerie stillness hangs in the air… a graveyard silence. For that is what this land has become—a cemetery where the dead can never rest. Ghosts wander endlessly, trapped forever in the echoes of their past lives."
 THE_NEW_EMPIRE:0 "The New Empire"
 THE_NEW_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "The New Empire was founded by the last refugees from the East and has since claimed the entire landmass as its own. A land of science, it remains almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world, focused solely on itself and the advancement of steel and chemistry. All princes look to the Emperor in Yach, who determines their fate, yet the dukes of Bakavia, Schwöringen, and the Northland have their own plans for the future."
