 use_slaves_title:0 "Exploit Slaves"

She either weaves them into her plans or disposes of them..."
 blood_of_kings_title:0 "Blood of Kings"
 blood_of_kings_desc:0 "For a long time, Akna only drank and bathed in the blood of virgins and beautiful youths, but the stories of her new guests have led her to seek other means to maintain her beauty. What could be nobler than the blood of princes, kings, and princesses? However, this is no easy task; rather than luring them to Ellemera, her courtiers must venture out and abduct them."
 ever_beaty_title:0 "Ever beautiful"
 ever_beaty_desc:0 "Akna is increasingly frustrated by the numerous rejuvenation rituals she must undergo to maintain her beauty and is now seeking a permanent solution.

 sorrow_of_the_heart_title:0 "Sorrow of the Heart"

 search_of_a_soul_title:0 "To posses a Soul"
 search_of_a_soul_desc:0 "It must be the soul that gives humans and animals the power of love and sorrow, and the certainty of an afterlife. Akna has been killed a few times in her mortal form, but never thoroughly enough to prevent her from restoring herself. It's a painful process, but it is possible. However, if it were not possible, the Varjojen would not pass into the afterlife but cease to exist entirely. Nothing frightens Akna more than this death, but if she had a soul, there would be something beyond... But how does one acquire a soul?"
 to_gain_a_soul_title:0 "To gain a Soul"
 to_gain_a_soul_desc:0 "A soul can only be granted by a god, but neither the Sky Father nor the Goddess of Death would ever do so. The former would hate her too much, and the latter would listen too closely to her son, who would never approve of such a thing for his slaves. However, the endless grace of the Sun could make it possible... but why would she help Akna, given that she has consumed hundreds of her worshippers? No one possesses such a great heart and such boundless kindness. It is time to learn more about her."
 blessed_akna_title:0 "Akna the Blessed"
 blessed_akna_desc:0 "The Sun can forgive all things, but one must live by its rules. Whether Akna is willing to do so is up to her. On the other hand, there is another way to attain immortality: to harness the power of the Sun itself and achieve divinity, thereby escaping the mortal realm."
 hunting_for_blood_title:0 "Hunting the Prey"
 hunting_for_blood_desc:0 "The Varjojen are constantly hungry, and Akna's servants are no exception.

Akna would be wise to seek out the undesirables in her lands and eradicate them."
 plague_the_southern_coast_title:0 "Plague of the Southern Coast"
 plague_the_southern_coast_desc:0 "The people in the south— in the land of Skogen— are easy prey for us, but the journey there is not straightforward. Rivers and the sea block our path, and no Varjoje will ever willingly cross flowing water— though frozen water poses no obstacle. We must either cross the rivers in winter or, in particularly harsh conditions, traverse the pack ice and cleanse the northern coasts of all the inhabitants we can find."
 hunt_the_tribes_title:0 "Hunt them down"
 hunt_the_tribes_desc:0 "The Skogen leave their homeland and move further south into the land. Yet we will follow them, driven by hunger. Akna, through defectors who follow her dreams, has learned much about the north and knows precisely where her warriors must go to satisfy their hunger."
 blood_ttribute_title:0 "Demand Subjugation"

 varjore_noble_title:0 "Varjorjen Masters"
 varjore_noble_desc:0 "The truth Akna has always known is that the Varjorjen are simply poor stewards and always will be. It is not in their nature, and everything they attempt succeeds at best only halfway... but humans can do all these things too. The Varjorjen do not need to manage the territories; they only need to have enough to eat. Let the humans handle the other tasks!"
 bone_coast_title:0 "The Bone Coast"

 the_fall_of_yutuu_title:0 "Destroy Yutu"
 the_fall_of_yutuu_desc:0 "Yutu led Thorren's armies and was his greatest marshal. Before the final battle, Akna invited him to a feast, causing him to neglect his duties, and Thorren fell. Yet this did not diminish his desire for Akna, and he remains deeply displeasing to her. A brutal man, arrogant beyond measure, he is a constant thorn in her side and almost uncontrollable. His tribe must be scattered to the winds, and Yutu must be imprisoned in the deepest hole that can be found in the North."

 subjugate_the_varjorjen_desc:0 "The remaining Varjojen tribes are to join our banner, but perhaps violence is no longer necessary, as many are eager to serve us, hoping to be chosen by Akna. A few must, of course, be removed, but whether through bloodshed or persuasion, the great white North will bow to Akna, the Eternal Mistress."

 second_choices_title:0 "Second Choices"
 second_choices_desc:0 "To Akna's not insignificant jealousy, her plan worked far better than expected, and soon, fewer came for her, while many more sought to be paired with one of her ladies-in-waiting. However, after overcoming her jealousy, she decided to embrace this fact and, like a spider, began to weave a grand web."
 
 the_conclave_title:0 "The Conclave"
 the_conclave_desc:0 "Most of the firstborn female Varjojen have gouged out their eyes in a gruesome ritual to see the future.

 recloate_to_ellemera_desc:0 "On the mainland, it is no longer safe, and it would be wiser for the seeresses to come to Ellemera, where Akna can ensure their protection. The council has agreed, and they will move as soon as the necessary preparations have been made."
 grand_sisterhood_of_faith_title:0 "Grand Sisterhood of Fate"
 grand_sisterhood_of_faith_desc:0 "The council may convene behind closed doors in Ellemera to discuss their prophecies, but the true power lies with Akna, to whom everyone must go for access.
