 the_empire_of_man_title:0 "Handle the Empire"
 the_empire_of_man_desc:0 "The Empire of Humanity has, for the moment, accepted us — but their tolerance is brittle. Beneath polite accords lies a clear truth: many among them harbor a deep hatred of those who are not human and would sooner see us wiped away than tolerate us forever. For now, however, we must buy time. Let us shroud our true strengths, consolidate our allies, and move with caution and purpose while the lull holds; when the hour comes, we will be ready."
 prepare_independce_title:0 "Prepare our Independence"
 prepare_independce_desc:0 "The war with the Empire will be bloody and long — we must prepare for siege and attrition. We will build fortresses, stockpile provisions, and gird ourselves for a campaign of endurance. Let granaries be filled, lines of supply secured, and watchtowers crowned with steel; every pass must be held and every road defended. The desert will be our ally — it will swallow their columns and starve their strength — and we shall make the wasteland an instrument of our victory."

The wind carries our battle cries across the desert — freedom for the Children of the Scorpion, victory for those who fear neither heat nor death!"
 expand_scorpionsdom_title:0 "Expand the Scorpionrealm"
 expand_scorpionsdom_desc:0 "The lands of our people must grow — the lifeless desert awaits us. Where others see only heat and emptiness, we see promise and purpose. The blazing sun that withers lesser beings only strengthens our kind. In the dry winds and shifting sands, the Scorpionfolk shall thrive and build a new dominion. The desert is not our enemy — it is our cradle, our fortress, and our future."
 red_land_dominance_title:0 "Dominate the Red Land"
 red_land_dominance_desc:0 "They named it the Red Land for the color of its endless dunes — blood-sand that gleams beneath the sun. The place is hollow now, a silence that yearns to be filled. It waits for the Children of the Scorpion to stride forth, to settle spine and stone, and to complete the holy work laid upon us by the stars and the scorching sky. Let the banners be raised; let the drums beat like distant thunder. The Red Land calls — and we shall answer."
 primus_inter_pares_title:0 "Primus Inter Pares"
 primus_inter_pares_desc:0 "Among the Scorpion Lords, none stands above another, for the blood of the desert flows equally in every vein. Yet even the strongest storms need a center. Thus shall one be chosen — the First Among Equals — to carry the words of the three great tribes, to unite their claws and hearts beneath a single purpose. His rule will not be of domination, but of balance, as the desert itself teaches: strength without unity is scattered sand."
 pious_scorpions_title:0 "Pious Scorpions"
 pious_scorpions_desc:0 "The gods molded us from sand and starlight for one sacred task alone — to watch over the Eternal Tomb. From the first dawn to the last dusk, we have stood vigilant, our stingers poised, our hearts bound to the duty entrusted to us. To guard the Tomb is not merely our purpose; it is our faith, our glory, and the essence of who we are. So long as one Scorpion draws breath, the sacred seal shall never be broken."
 fortfiy_sacntum_title:0 "Defend the Most Holy of Places"
 fortfiy_sacntum_desc:0 "By sand and starlight, by stinger and bone, we vow: the Tomb shall never open while we draw breath. We bind our lives to its secret; we will lay down our claws before we loosen the seal. Let any who threaten it find only our fury and the wrath of the gods."
 harness_power_title:0 "Harness a Little Power"
 harness_power_desc:0 "The Tomb harbors power beyond all knowing — a flame as deep as the stars. We propose to draw a fragment of that force, not for greed, but to fulfill our sacred charge: to strengthen the guardians, renew the seals, and shield the hoard from ruin. The gods have entrusted this burden to us; if we wield this power with reverence, restraint, and solely for the Tomb’s protection, it shall not be deemed sacrilege, but the completion of our sacred duty."
 the_inner_chamber_title:0 "The Inner Chamber"
 the_inner_chamber_desc:0 "We shall breach the inner sanctum and draw still more of the Tomb’s boundless force—yet let none mistake our purpose. This is not hunger for dominion, but the strengthening of the Watch and the renewal of the seals that bind the secret. There stands, beyond that inner hall, a further gate—an awful threshold we shall never unloose. We will take what is needed, bind it fast to our duty, and leave the final portal sealed and untouched for all ages."
 the_whole_sanctum_title:0 "The Inner Sanctum"

Our sentinels will stand eternal; our seals will never slacken. Let it be known: the strength behind the last door will be yoked to our duty, and the guardianship of the Tomb shall endure for all ages."
 saltssss_title:0 "Salt"
 saltssss_desc:0 "At the center of the Red Land sprawls the Red Desert, a plain of wind-carved dunes and towering, uncanny statues of salt—pillars and figures shaped by storm and time. From those white monuments we will take wealth: the salt of the desert shall be quarried, piled, and carried to market. Let the caravans run and the drums call; from these strange columns we will draw coin and sustenance for our people."
 prosper_cities_title:0 "Prosperous cities"
 prosper_cities_desc:0 "For the Children of the Scorpion we shall raise mighty cities upon the sands. Where once there was only drift and heat, there will stand stone and shadow — markets and halls, temples and forges — homes for our kin and fortresses for our law. Let the drums call the builders and the banners mark each rising street: the desert will become the cradle of our new greatness."
 cntrol_caravan_title:0 "Control the Caravans"
 cntrol_caravan_desc:0 "Let it be known across sand and wind: every caravan that dares cross our desert shall pay tribute at our gates. The great roads that bind the Red Land run under our watch; their loads will pass only when the coin of the Watch is paid. Those who would trade here must honor our claim — for the salt of the dunes, the safety of the route, and the right of passage are ours to grant."
 art_of_war_sc_title:0 "Art of War"
 art_of_war_sc_desc:0 "Warcraft is our craft now—essential in these days when diplomacy alone cannot mend all wounds. Let every mind turn to strategy, every body to training, and every heart to iron resolve.

 raiders_of_lost_ark_title:0 "Raiders of the Lost Ark"
 raiders_of_lost_ark_desc:0 "The ancient gods carved secrets into this sand and left relics of power where only the bold would tread. Among those gifts lies the legendary Ark of the Covenant — a vessel of old light that, when a true-hearted warrior peers into it, floods them with iron courage and unshakable resolve. Let it be declared: the Ark shall be found, brought to our people, and used to steel the hosts of the Scorpionfolk. Its power will not be hoarded for glory, but wielded to fulfill our sacred duty and secure the Tomb."
 find_the_holy_grail_title:0 "Find the Holy Grail"
 find_the_holy_grail_desc:0 "Legends speak of a Grail hidden in the sands, a vessel whose waters grant near‑eternal youth and the vigor of unbroken health. Such a gift is not for idle hands — it is for the Children of the Scorpion, to strengthen our kin, our Watch, and our sacred duty. Let it be known: we shall seek this Grail, uncover it, and drink its blessing, so that our people may endure as long as the desert sun and the stars above."
 the_grand_ship_title:0 "Seek Utnapischtims Ship"
 the_grand_ship_desc:0 "When the Great Flood swept the lands, Utnapishtim preserved life itself, carrying all creatures upon his mighty vessel. That ship now lies hidden somewhere in the desert, its timbers as strong as the mountains and as enduring as the sun. Its wood, nearly indestructible, is a treasure beyond measure — capable of fortifying our halls, our weapons, and even our sacred defenses. Let it be sought, uncovered, and put to use for the glory and survival of the Children of the Scorpion."
