Such was the divine order — and by this order, dominion over the realm of life was the birthright of Thorren, the Son of Heaven and Earth.\n But the Father spurned him, decreeing that no god should ever rule the world of mortals. Yet the Mother’s heart defied this command. She whispered to her son, nurturing in him the flame of belief in his rightful inheritance.\n Thus, Thorren rose in defiance of his Father’s will. From the shadows he shaped his servants — the Varjorjen, grotesque beings in human likeness, born of darkness and loyalty. With their aid he sought to conquer the living world and remake it according to his vision.\n But the mortals, united beneath the Banner of the Lightning, stood against him. In the Great War of the Heavens and Earth, the Politian Empire shattered his armies and stormed his fortress, for his faithful general Yutu had failed to guard the flank at the crucial hour.\n Defeated, Thorren’s divine essence was bound within a mighty relic and sealed away for all time. Yet his children endure — the Varjorjen still walk the world, whispering prayers to their Father, the Banished God, who even in chains remains the shadow of power and the promise of return."

It stands as a relic of a time before men and their empires, before stone cities and steel crowns. Here the wild magic of creation still breathes, untouched by the hand of civilization.\nTravelers who dare its shadowed paths tell strange tales. They say that time flows differently beneath its boughs, that the seasons twist and blur, and that the air itself shimmers with an unnatural clarity — as though the world within the forest were older, truer, and infinitely more alive.\nYet there are darker stories, whispered in the taverns of border towns and among the woodcutters who vanish one by one. Villages found empty, children gone without a trace, ghostly figures seen flitting between trees at dusk. There are tales of voices in the fog, of diseased beasts and vengeful dead who wander aimlessly near the heart of the woods.\nAnd all these tales are true.\nAt the center of the §YGloomwood§! lies a lonely cabin on a sunless clearing, its windows dark, its door always open. To those who step inside, it appears a simple dwelling — until the illusion fades. Then they see it for what it truly is: a palace of rot and shadow, the seat of the Twin Lords of the Gloomwood — §YLucan and Lucy§!.\nNeither human nor elf nor any known race, Lucan and Lucy are beings from the world before the gods, the last survivors of an age erased by divine fire. They endured the War of Creation by devouring the souls of their kin, binding themselves to death and life in a single, eternal form.\nFor centuries they have lingered in the forest’s heart, feeding on the slow trickle of lost wanderers. But now, their hunger has grown. The §YGloomwood§! stirs, and its rulers prepare to reclaim what was once theirs — spreading their shadow beyond the trees to harvest new souls, to preserve their eternal youth and beauty.\nFor §YLucan and Lucy§! are the nameless horror of the deep woods, the cold pulse in the heart of the green, the whisper that follows every lost traveler:Come closer, child of men… The forest remembers you."

But the days of the Politans have long since passed, their marble halls now buried beneath layers of moss and time. Today, Colaiste is a modest settlement perched upon ancient ruins, yet its spirit endures, and with it, a quiet, determined power.\nUnder the wise and steadfast rule of §YLiam II§!, Colaiste has risen once more. From the ashes of empire, he has forged a realm united by ambition and resilience. His policies of alliance, trade, and cunning diplomacy have extended Colaistian influence deep into the valleys, transforming the city into the greatest power of the region.\nIn the last great war, Colaiste dared to challenge the dominance of §RWynedd§!, the long-standing rival of the valleys. The campaign was hard-fought and uncertain, but for the first time in generations, Wynedd’s supremacy was shaken — perhaps even broken forever.\nStill, the struggle is not yet done. To the north, the people of §RCaobdh§! resist, clinging to their independence in the high passes, cut off from their allies and surrounded on all sides. But time is against them, and every year Colaiste grows stronger.\nEven if §YLiam II§! himself may not live to see it, the dream he has rekindled burns brighter than ever — that Colaiste will once again unite the Valleys under one banner, not as conquerors, but as free people bound by destiny."
