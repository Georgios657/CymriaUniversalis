Should the city ever fall, his enemies would surely destroy him, plunging our Empire into a crisis unlike any it has ever faced. His immobility is both the source of his eternal rule and our greatest vulnerability, and thus the safety of the capital is paramount above all else.n\nThe Imperial Army’s campaign in Broden demands immense resources, straining our coffers and supply lines. Yet this burden is not without purpose. With time, discipline, and a measure of fortune, these territories will soon be fully annexed, strengthening the Empire’s borders and securing its future."
 string_start_empire_of_man:0 "The §GEmpire of Humanity§! was founded more than a thousand years ago by §GArno Lichian§!. Little is known of his true origins, shrouded as they are in secrecy and legend. What is known, however, is that the immortal §GGod-Emperor Arno§! led his armies in every direction, conquering vast lands through countless wars and forging a dominion without equal.n\nIn time, Arno withdrew from the battlefield and retreated into his palace, where through powerful magic he achieved immortality—at the modest price of never being able to move again. Bound to his throne yet eternal, he now guides the fate of humanity from this sacred seat, while his generals march in his name, subjugating new lands and kingdoms.n\nThe latest expansions have driven the Empire toward §RVjirta§! and the regions bordering §YBroden§!, where §Rharpies§! threaten human settlements and defy imperial order. This holy mission must never cease, for humanity is surrounded on all sides by enemies: §Rnon-humans§! in the §Rnorth§!, §Reast§!, and §Rwest§!, and §Rdemons§! in the south. Only strength, unity, and unyielding resolve can ensure survival in such an age.n\nAnd thus Arno endures—God-Emperor, Immortal Sovereign, the pillar upon which mankind rests. From his former mortal form sprang a vast lineage, a great family that now rules innumerable client states. Numerous enough to fill the ranks of the entire nobility, his descendants bind the Empire together through blood, loyalty, and divine authority.n\nSo long as §GArno§! reigns, humanity shall not stand alone."

For generations, it lived in submission to the King of Gira, its fate bound to a distant throne. It was only through a long and brutal war that the grandfather of §GDuchess Kassy§!, allied with §YAbyssia§!, finally wrested independence from §RKing Gassa I§!.n\n Since that victory, the small island realm has faced relentless challenges. Pirates prowled its waters, the §Rkings of Gira§! never fully abandoned their claims, and the §Rlords of Eldar§! watched with covetous eyes. True peace was rare, and more than once it seemed as though Garia’s independence would be lost once more. Yet time and again, the island endured—often buying its survival with the gold earned from its unrivaled position as a hub of trade and seafaring commerce.n\n Now a new chapter begins. The last duke, Kar, has died unexpectedly, and his eldest daughter, §GKassy§!, has succeeded him. Young and still inexperienced, she is nonetheless a visionary. She dreams of a greater Garia—one that commands the waves, sails the uncharted oceans, and rises as a true maritime power.n\n In her vision, all will respect §GGaria in the Sea§!: its kin in Gira, its rivals in Eldar. The witch-masters will fear its reach, and untold riches will flow into its harbors. Whether this dream will become destiny remains to be seen—but the tides are shifting, and Garia stands once more at the edge of history."
 string_start_religion_the_lord_of_demons:0 "Beyond this world, other worlds exist—parallel realms, alien and profoundly different. One of these is the Demon World, a realm inhabited by monstrous beings driven by cruelty, brawling fury, and an unending lust for battle. These demons are ruled by their King, a being of relentless ambition who ceaselessly seeks to spread chaos beyond his own realm and into worlds not his own. His will is conquest, his purpose destruction, and his gaze is ever fixed upon the mortal world. In certain places, the veil that separates the worlds grows thin and fragile. There, the Demon King reaches out through dreams and dark visions, calling upon his followers to raise his great gates. Through these portals, he intends to pour his legions into the world, tearing reality open and drowning it in madness, fire, and war. Thus the boundary between worlds is not merely a barrier—but a battleground yet to be fully revealed."

These spirits possess only modest power, and beyond the boundaries of their own domains they are weak and vulnerable. Yet despite their limitations, they remain devoted to those who believe in them. Within their waters, valleys, and shores, they offer what protection they can—guiding travelers, calming storms, blessing fields, or warding off subtle dangers. Though they are not mighty gods of legend, they are close, familiar presences, bound to the land and to the people who honor them. In Tilidan, faith is not placed in distant heavens, but in the living landscape itself."

It was Heukdalma who bestowed upon the merfolk the gift of transformation, granting them the ability to change their form and move between worlds of water and land. Feared and revered in equal measure, she embodies the shifting nature of the sea itself—calm and guiding one moment, merciless and consuming the next—an eternal force presiding over life, death, and the endless tides between them.n\nHear now of the Lady of the Underworld. Once she was the bride of the Sky Father, yet strife parted them, and she withdrew into her own dominion. There she reigns in silence, over all who fall from life and whose souls descend to her halls. Around her walk her servants, the elves, formed from the dark soil of her realm and filled with breath that is not true life. Through them she sees, through them she hears. Though mortals fear her name, she is no foe. She is the Queen of the Afterlife, and she waits with patience beyond time. For in the end, all paths bend toward her gate, and all souls must rest beneath her crown."

They toppled the old giant-gods, drove the giants into the farthest and coldest corners of the earth, and shaped the world anew for their chosen people: §Rhumankind§!. The Age of Fire, Storm, and Death shattered the might of the giants and cast them down from greatness.\nIn the remote reaches of the far north, the giants eventually escaped the gaze of the new gods, who had become entangled in their own quarrels. There the giants carved out countless jarldoms, forging alliances and breaking them again in endless cycles of rivalry and war, until at last only three great cities endured: §GJotunheim§!, §RMuspelheim§!, and §RNiflheim§!.\nBut even this fragile balance did not last. The §Rtrolls of Sveri§! descended upon the land, pillaging and burning, pushing the giants back behind the walls of their cities. A long and terrible war followed—a war fought with steel, sorcery, and the dying embers of ancient power. In the end, the §RTroll-Realm§! was shattered and the surviving §Rtrolls§! brought to heel, though the giants themselves emerged severely diminished and nearly extinct.\nNow they hold their lands once more, yet peace is thin as ice. In the halls of §GJotunheim§!, the jarls still dream of the lost Giant-Realm… and of vengeance.\nOf steel and blood.\nOf victory and glory."

Such was the divine order — and by this order, dominion over the realm of life was the birthright of Thorren, the Son of Heaven and Earth.\n But the Father spurned him, decreeing that no god should ever rule the world of mortals. Yet the Mother’s heart defied this command. She whispered to her son, nurturing in him the flame of belief in his rightful inheritance.\n Thus, Thorren rose in defiance of his Father’s will. From the shadows he shaped his servants — the Varjorjen, grotesque beings in human likeness, born of darkness and loyalty. With their aid he sought to conquer the living world and remake it according to his vision.\n But the mortals, united beneath the Banner of the Lightning, stood against him. In the Great War of the Heavens and Earth, the Politian Empire shattered his armies and stormed his fortress, for his faithful general Yutu had failed to guard the flank at the crucial hour.\n Defeated, Thorren’s divine essence was bound within a mighty relic and sealed away for all time.

This devotion runs deep, shaping their customs, their loyalties, and their resolve. When their homeland is threatened, they often stand firm, determined to defend it to the last man, seeing such sacrifice not as loss, but as a sacred duty to the Earth Mother herself.\n The people of Avernia believe that their land has been blessed by the Great Mother. They hold that she still dwells among the rolling hills and rugged cliffs, her presence woven into stone, soil, and wind alike. From there, she watches over the land, guarding it from harm and bestowing it with abundant harvests.\n To the Avernians, the fertility of their fields and the endurance of their homeland are living proof of her favor.

One day she came upon a great land tortoise that had fallen upon its back, helpless beneath the open sky. Moved by compassion and guided by the kindness of her heart, Tanit aided the creature and set it upright once more.\n Only then did the truth reveal itself: the tortoise was none other than the Great Earth Deity, ancient and vast beyond mortal understanding. In gratitude for Tanit’s selfless act, the goddess bestowed upon her divine power, granting her dominion over all the lands she could behold from the summit of Mount Keen, raising her up as a new and living goddess.\n At the nearby shore, Tanit founded the city of Arakeen, and there she ruled as queen for one hundred and eleven years. Her reign was marked by wisdom, prosperity, and peace.

In her fury, she unleashes flame and ruin, pouring molten lava across the land and reducing all before her to ash and stone.\n Now, with the arrival of merchants and foreign influences, the ancient tribes are in retreat, and faith in Robin begins to waver.

Enraged by this act of defiance, Asae seized his bronze axe and struck at the vile intruder.\n Such was his power that the blow did not merely miss its mark—it split the land itself, tearing it open and giving birth to the Giranian Sea and its long, winding bay.

He spoke to the trolls with a voice like flowing water and promised them that they were not abandoned. He showed them where the land was fertile, where the river would shelter them, and how they might survive the coming trials.\n From that day onward, the Waller became their sacred guardian. Whenever the trolls faced ruin, starvation, or defeat, he would rise again from the river’s depths, offering guidance, protection, or strength in their darkest hour. Thus was born Wallerism, the faith that teaches patience, endurance, and trust in the deep currents of fate.\n Even now, the faithful believe that when the river grows unnaturally still and the water darkens at dusk, the Waller is watching—and when the need is greatest, he will come once more."
 string_start_religion_fore_bearers:0 "[Root.start_religion_intro]\nAmong giants and trolls, faith does not rest in distant gods alone, but in the Great Ancestors—those mighty forebears whose deeds shaped the world and whose blood still flows through living veins. It is believed that these ancestors, whether troll or giant, gaze down from the high halls of the beyond, watching the actions of their descendants with stern but watchful eyes.\n Life is seen as a trial. Strength, endurance, loyalty, and courage are the measures by which one is judged. To live weakly or dishonorably is to shame one’s lineage; to live bravely is to honor the ancestors and add weight to their ancient names. Every battle fought, every oath kept, and every hardship endured becomes proof of worth.\n This belief culminates in the vision of the Day of Judgment, a grim and solemn reckoning known in the northern tongues as the Last Moot. On that day, the ancestors will rise and call the living to stand before them. Only those who have proven themselves through deed and sacrifice will be permitted to stand at their side, joining the endless feast and the eternal struggle beyond the world.\n Rituals of the ancestor cult are stark and northern in character. Blood is spilled upon stone, names of the dead are carved into wood and bone, and sagas are sung around roaring fires beneath open skies. The dead are not mourned in silence but remembered in strength, for to be forgotten is the greatest death of all.\n Thus giants and trolls strive not merely to survive, but to be worthy of remembrance—for in the north, honor outlives flesh, and the ancestors are never truly gone."

Villages are abandoned, forests become labyrinths of writhing vegetation, and the air itself feels heavy with a malignant presence. To survive, the people offer sacrifices, hoping to appease this dark force, seeking mercy where mercy is rare.\n Legends say that the Gloom is not merely destruction—it is life unbound, corrupted and relentless, a reminder that nature itself, if untamed and tainted by magic, can become a horror beyond reckoning."

Here the wild magic of creation still breathes, untouched by the hand of civilization.\nTravelers who dare its shadowed paths tell strange tales. They say that time flows differently beneath its boughs, that the seasons twist and blur, and that the air itself shimmers with an unnatural clarity — as though the world within the forest were older, truer, and infinitely more alive.\nYet there are darker stories, whispered in the taverns of border towns and among the woodcutters who vanish one by one. Villages found empty, children gone without a trace, ghostly figures seen flitting between trees at dusk. There are tales of voices in the fog, of diseased beasts and vengeful dead who wander aimlessly near the heart of the woods.\nAnd all these tales are true.\nAt the center of the §YGloomwood§! lies a lonely cabin on a sunless clearing, its windows dark, its door always open. To those who step inside, it appears a simple dwelling — until the illusion fades. Then they see it for what it truly is: a palace of rot and shadow, the seat of the Twin Lords of the Gloomwood — §YLucan and Lucy§!.\nNeither human nor elf nor any known race, Lucan and Lucy are beings from the world before the gods, the last survivors of an age erased by divine fire. They endured the War of Creation by devouring the souls of their kin, binding themselves to death and life in a single, eternal form.\nFor centuries they have lingered in the forest’s heart, feeding on the slow trickle of lost wanderers. But now, their hunger has grown. The §YGloomwood§! stirs, and its rulers prepare to reclaim what was once theirs — spreading their shadow beyond the trees to harvest new souls, to preserve their eternal youth and beauty.\nFor §YLucan and Lucy§! are the nameless horror of the deep woods, the cold pulse in the heart of the green, the whisper that follows every lost traveler:Come closer, child of men… The forest remembers you."

But the days of the Politans have long since passed, their marble halls now buried beneath layers of moss and time. Today, Colaiste is a modest settlement perched upon ancient ruins, yet its spirit endures, and with it, a quiet, determined power.\nUnder the wise and steadfast rule of §YLiam II§!, Colaiste has risen once more. From the ashes of empire, he has forged a realm united by ambition and resilience. His policies of alliance, trade, and cunning diplomacy have extended Colaistian influence deep into the valleys, transforming the city into the greatest power of the region.\nIn the last great war, Colaiste dared to challenge the dominance of §RWynedd§!, the long-standing rival of the valleys. The campaign was hard-fought and uncertain, but for the first time in generations, Wynedd’s supremacy was shaken — perhaps even broken forever.\nStill, the struggle is not yet done. To the north, the people of §RCaobdh§! resist, clinging to their independence in the high passes, cut off from their allies and surrounded on all sides. But time is against them, and every year Colaiste grows stronger.\nEven if §YLiam II§! himself may not live to see it, the dream he has rekindled burns brighter than ever — that Colaiste will once again unite the Valleys under one banner, not as conquerors, but as free people bound by destiny."
