A hunched figure stepped inside — cloaked in furs, soaked to the bone, eyes glowing faintly beneath a bone-carved headdress. The soothsayer-shaman. Silence fell among the gathered trolls as the storm seemed to pause for breath. Then, in a voice like gravel and wind, she spoke of a vision: a prophecy long forgotten. “The West,” she rasped, “is where our fate lies. The land of our ancestors calls to us.

To them, the Wels is no mere beast, but a god of enlightenment — a spirit of wisdom that swims the veins of the earth. Letting it go, they say, is not weakness… but sacred duty."
