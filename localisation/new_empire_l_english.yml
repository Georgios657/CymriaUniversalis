 new_empire.11.ast:0 "Killing an immortal is no easy task, yet every living being has a soul or some essence that drives it. For our mages, it was not a great challenge to combine their powers in a grand communion, banishing the entity from the realm of the living forever."

 new_empire.11.necro:0 "The realm of the dead is where all souls go, but the immortals refuse to enter it. The beast, however, lacks even a soul to send there. Yet through dark rituals, it can still be rendered harmless. In mere minutes, thousands of years pass, until barely a trace of its body remains. Now, unable to die, the beast languishes in a grave, reduced to a mere shadow of its former self."
 new_empire.11.nat:0 "The power of nature is the true triumph over immortality. Though the beast constantly regenerates, it is endlessly devoured by thousands of worms, beetles, and other insects, forcing it to endure an eternal martyrdom of dying and being consumed."
 new_empire.11.var:0 "Adalbert, a Varjorje from the Jarvinen tribe, is a traitor to Thorren and his people. The wise ones of the Varjorje know the rituals to kill one of their own permanently and send them into the Great Light. This ritual has now been performed, and Adalbert will trouble us no more."
