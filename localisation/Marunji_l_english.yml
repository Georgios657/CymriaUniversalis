The land will no longer shield its people; the spirits of the jungle, the peaks, and the waters will be our servants. The ancient curses will turn in our favor, and the beasts that once ruled the wilderness will be nothing but slaves to our call.Every man, woman, and child who walks the Witchlands shall know that their lives are no longer their own. They shall serve us, whether they wish it or not.

Their rebellions will be crushed beneath the weight of our power, and the wild magics they dare wield will be twisted and consumed by our dark arts.No more will the Witchlands be a refuge for the lawless or the weak. We will purge our lands of any who do not kneel, and any who resist will find their end swift and merciless.Our dominion will be absolute.

The deep caverns rich with ores and crystals shall feed our dark forges, forging weapons and artifacts of unparalleled power. The swamps, teeming with unnatural life, shall become breeding grounds for our most fearsome creations, twisted by our craft and bound to our will.Every corner of the Witchlands will be bled dry, every hidden resource plundered for our purposes. No part of this land will remain untouched — not the mountains, nor the rivers, nor the very soil beneath our feet.We shall harvest what the land has hidden for centuries, and with each harvest, our strength shall grow.So it is written.

The minds of their leaders will fracture as the spirits of their soil turn against them, bent to our will.In time, the banners will fall not to battle — but to surrender.

Their leaders will be chosen not for their strength, but for their unwavering devotion to our cause. Any who resist will find their fates sealed by the whispers of our spies and the reach of our magic.Second, we shall create bindings — both magical and psychological — to ensure no rebellion can rise. Rituals of control will be enacted across the lands, planting dark sigils in their cities and strongholds, ensuring that the very land they walk upon is imbued with our power. These sigils will serve as anchors, and any who rise in defiance will feel the weight of our curse upon them.Finally, we shall foster division, turning brother against brother, friend against friend, so that the seeds of rebellion can never grow. Let them fight among themselves, while we remain the true power, unseen and unchallenged.Their loyalty will be a chain forged not by threat, but by our very presence. A chain that no force in the world can break.So it shall be. So it must be."

Every whisper of rebellion is crushed before it takes root, every voice of dissent silenced by the force of our magics.The people are ours to command, their hearts bound by the spells we weave, their minds shaped by the truths we tell. Those who once dared to dream of freedom now bow to our vision, for in their hearts, they know that there is no escape from our reach. Their loyalty is a given, forged by fear, devotion, and enchantment.Averia, in all its breadth — its cities, its lands, its very soul — is now a perfect home for us, the true masters of this world.

There, the future shall be decided — not by sword, but by spell, by oath, by pact.Together, they shall forge the policies that will shape the coming age. An age of control, of secrecy, of unshakable order. Dissent among us shall not be tolerated.

Instead, we shall do what we have always done best: strike in silence. Our poisons — crafted in the deepest swamps and whispered into the veins of serpents — shall find their way into goblets, into feasts, into the very air our rivals breathe.Their deaths will be quiet. Unnoticed. Untraceable.And when the last of them falls, choking on their ambition, the world will belong to us alone.No one shall remember their names — only that they failed to stop us.So it is planned.

No heir shall survive to whisper revenge, no friend to carry their memory, no monument to speak of their deeds.We will unmake them. Entire lineages shall vanish as though they never walked this world. The land will forget them — and in forgetting, will belong to us.Let none who stood beside our enemies be spared.

Given our enemies cause to hope.But no more.We shall bring order to the lands of the arcane. No spell shall be cast without sanction, no duel fought without decree. The age of unbridled ambition is over. In its place, we shall forge a system — of ranks, of laws, of oaths unbreakable.All witchlords and sorcerers shall submit to the Grand Covenant. Those who defy it will be stripped of power, name, and flesh. Peace shall not come through kindness — but through absolute control.Only through unity shall our dominion endure.Let the fires of discord be smothered. Let stillness reign.So it is spoken. So it shall begin."

They mastered death, defied age, and believed themselves eternal — yet when they fell, they left only chaos in their wake.Apprentices tore each other apart. Covens splintered. Blood was spilled over empty thrones and forgotten scrolls. Our order weakened with every generation lost to ambition without guidance.This shall end now.We decree the foundation of a true succession — a path not of chance, but of purpose. Each Hexenmeister shall name an heir, bound by blood, magic, or will. The chosen shall be tested, trained, and marked by the Circle of Black Flame. Their loyalty shall be sealed by oath, their failure punished by unmaking.No master shall leave this world without a successor. No throne shall stand empty. No power shall pass uncontrolled.From now on, the legacy of every sorcerer shall be shaped, preserved, and enforced. In this, our dominion shall find its future — unbroken and unchallenged.So it is written. So it shall endure."

Their magic flickers beside our storm. Their relics crumble before our rituals. Their names shall be forgotten as ours are etched in the bones of the earth.We are no longer one among many.We are the power.We are the future.We are the Witchlands — reborn in order, sharpened by purpose, and ready to ascend.The age of rivals has ended.The age of dominion has begun.So it is declared.

Their mountains shall no longer shield them, and their ancient oaths shall mean nothing to the dead.We shall draw the spirits of frost and stone into chains of spellcraft, bending their will to our cause. Once broken, the highlanders will find no warmth, no hope, and no allies — only the creeping hush of death among the snows.Even the hardest earth can crack. Even the coldest strongholds can rot.And in that rot, we shall plant our sigils."

In coin, in materials, in spell-essence, in blood if need be. The flow of resources will fuel our forges, fill our vaults, and empower our rituals.Let it be known:Those who pay shall be protected.Those who delay shall be punished.Those who refuse shall be erased.The tax is not a burden.

Every soul counted.None shall be overlooked — from the lowliest herb-cutter in the marsh to the silent ghost-seers of the mountain shrines. All shall be known.Their worth shall be measured. Their obligations calculated. Their loyalty weighed.From this knowledge, we shall craft precise taxation, efficient tribute routes, and a deeper mastery over the rhythm of our realm. Let no tongue whisper of hidden settlements or untapped potential — for all shall be revealed to the Circle.And those who hide, who lie, who seek to escape the count — they shall be found, and marked as traitors.To count is not mere recordkeeping.

This is their duty — their sacred price for being allowed to live beneath the protection of our shadow.Let it be known:Those who meet their quotas shall be spared the gaze of the collectors.Those who exceed them shall be rewarded with silence and safety.But those who fail… shall know suffering beyond coin.Famine will be no excuse. Fire will be no refuge. Plague will not shield them. They shall pay, in gold or in screams.For tribute is not a request. It is the lifeblood of dominion.So it is weighed. So it shall be paid."

But no longer.They walk our roads.They drink from our wells.They profit in our shadow.From this day forth, all trade shall be taxed. No wagon shall cross our borders without The Seal of Passage. No goods shall be exchanged without The Toll of the Circle.Let every crossing, every bridge, every market be watched. Let every merchant know: wealth flows only by our leave.Those who pay may trade in peace — beneath our protection.Those who evade shall lose more than their wares.The roads are ours.

No eye shall fully behold its scale. It shall rise higher than any tower, deeper than any crypt, its halls echoing with the weight of devotion.This is not merely a place of worship.

From within its stone walls, our god's influence shall spread, entwining with the very bones of the earth.Every soul — from the lowest peasant to the highest sorcerer — shall toil in its construction. Every coin, every gem, every blood-sacrifice shall be used in its making.
