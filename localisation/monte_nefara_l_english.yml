 pillars_of_wisdom_title:0 "Pillars of Wisdom"
 pillars_of_wisdom_desc:0 "We have spent our mortal time learning as much knowledge as possible, for we were the highest scholars of the realm, advisors to the Emperor himself—if only he had listened to us. Yet this pursuit has never left us, and even today, we strive for even more knowledge."
 pillars_of_eterinity_title:0 "Pillars of Eternity"
 pillars_of_eterinity_desc:0 "We are immortal... at least, that is the only conclusion we can draw from our current situation.

 our_scions_title:0 "Our Scions"
 our_scions_desc:0 "We were filled with joy when we learned that some of our people had escaped westward and founded a new realm there.

 unite_the_dead_desc:0 "It is difficult for us to take the imperial crown, but Jolien led the empire to ruin and failed—yes, shamefully failed—to hold it together. We were loyal, but what did it bring us? Evil sorcerers who enslaved us and a world that has slipped from our grasp."
 the_unwise_emperor_title:0 "The Unwise Emperor"
 the_unwise_emperor_desc:0 "Jolien... our uncle. Emperor. Condemner. We have many names for him, but beyond all that… he was simply incapable. We mourned his wife and child, but he took his grief too deeply to heart and, in doing so, cursed the land. He should rule no more."

 pacify_the_steppe_title:0 "Pacify the Steppe"
 pacify_the_steppe_desc:0 "The vast steppe in the east is wild and full of riders. These tribes have not lived in these lands for long, but times have changed. They cannot remain as free as they would like; we must bring them under control so that no one can hinder us in our important task."

 the_grand_palace_title:0 "The Grand Palace"
 the_grand_palace_desc:0 "The Imperial Palace in Polita was once truly the most beautiful place in the world, filled with monuments to victories. Trophies from all corners of the world were displayed here—from the shield of the Phoenix King to the swords of the barbarian kings and various spoils from the Great War. Though it has not been maintained for centuries, it remains almost untouched. It is our greatest pride and shall now be our home."
 marina_mortis_title:0 "Marina Mortis"
 marina_mortis_desc:0 "The fleet of the dead is also a fleet of the damned.
